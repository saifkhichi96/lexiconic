S
The nineteenth letter of the English alphabet, is a consonant, and is often called a sibilant, in allusion to its hissing sound. It has two principal sounds; one a more hissing, as in sack, this; the other a vocal hissing, as in is, wise. Besides these it sometimes has the sounds of sh and zh, as in sure, measure. It generally has its hissing sound at the beginning of words, but in the middle and at the end of words its sound is determined by usage. In a few words it is silent, as in isle, débris.
With the letter h it forms the digraph sh.

[Note] Both the form and the name of the letter S are derived from the
Latin, which got the letter through the Greek from the Phaenician. The ultimate origin is Egyptian. S is etymologically most nearly related to c, z, t, and r; as, in ice, OE. is; E. hence, OE. hennes; E. rase, raze; erase, razor; that, G. das; E. reason, F. raison, L. ratio; E. was, were; chair, chaise.

-S
-s.

1. The suffix used to form the plural of most words; as in roads, elfs, sides, accounts.

2. The suffix used to form the third person singular indicative of English verbs; as in the falls, tells, sends.

-- Sacrament, Eucharist.
-- Protestants apply the term sacrament to baptism and the Lord's
Supper, especially the latter. The R. Cath. and Greek churches have
five other sacraments, viz., confirmation, penance, holy orders,
matrimony, and extreme unction. As sacrament denotes an oath or vow,
the word has been applied by way of emphasis to the Lord's Supper,
where the most sacred vows are renewed by the Christian in
commemorating the death of his Redeemer. Eucharist denotes the giving
of thanks; and this term also has been applied to the same ordinance,
as expressing the grateful remembrance of Christ's sufferings and
death. "Some receive the sacrament as a means to procure great graces
and blessings; others as an eucharist and an office of thanksgiving
for what they have received." Jer. Taylor.

practical, are more frequently carried into effect.

Originally, a small, sharp-built vessel, with two topsails on
one or both masts and was called a topsail schooner. About 1840,
longer vesels with three masts, fore-and-aft rigged, came into use,
and since that time vesels with four masts and even with six masts,
so rigged, are built. Schooners with more than two masts are
designated three-masted schooners, four-masted schooners, etc. See
Illustration in Appendix.

[Note] The fist schooner ever constructed is said to have between
built in Gloucester, Massachusetts, about theyar 1713, by a Captain
Andrew Robinson, and to have received its name from the following
trivial circumstance: When the vessel went off the stocks into the
water, a bystander cried out,"O, how she scoons!" Robinson replied, "
A scooner let her be;" and, from that time, vessels thus masted and
rigged have gone by this name. The word scoon is popularly used in
some parts of New England to denote the act of making stones skip
along the surface of water. The Scottish scon means the same thing.
Both words are probably allied to the Icel. skunda, skynda, to make
haste, hurry, AS. scunian to avoid, shun, Prov. E. scun. In the New
England records, the word appears to have been originally written
scooner. Babson, in his "History of Gloucester," gives the following
extract from a letter written in that place Sept. 25, 1721, by Dr.
Moses Prince, brother of the Rev. Thomas Prince, the annalist of New
England: "This gentleman was first contriver of
schooners, and built the first of that sort about eight years since."

SCIENCE
Sci"ence, n.

1. Knowledge; lnowledge of principles and causes; ascertained truth
of facts.
If we conceive God's or science, before the creation, to be extended
to all and every part of the world, seeing everything as it is,...
his science or sight from all eternity lays no necessity on anything
to come to pass. Hammond.
Shakespeare's deep and accurate science in mental philosophy.
Coleridge.

2. Accumulated and established knowledge, which has been systematized
and formulated with reference to the discovery of general truths or
the operation of general laws; knowledge classified and made
available in work, life, or the search for truth; comprehensive,
profound, or philosophical knowledge.
All this new science that men lere. Chaucer.
Science is... a complement of cognitions, having, in point of
form, the character of logical perfection, and in point of matter,
the character of real truth. Sir W. Hamilton.

3. Especially, such knowledge when it relates to the physical world
and its phenomena, the nature, constitution, and forces of matter,
the qualities and function of living tissues, etc.; -- called also
natural science, and physical science.
Voltaire hardly left a single corner of the field entirely unexplored
in science, poetry, history, philosophy. J. Morley.

4. Any branch or departament of systematized knowledge considered as
a distinct field of investigation or object of study; as, the science
of astronomy, of chemistry, or of mind.

[Note] The ancients reckoned seven sciences, namely, grammar,
rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy; -- the
first three being included in the Trivium, the remaining four in the
Quadrivium.
Good sense, which only is the gift of Heaven, And though no science,
fairly worth the seven. Pope.

5. Art, skill, or expertness, regarded as the result of knowledge of
laws and principles.
His science, coolness, and great strength. G. A. Lawrence.

[Note] Science is applied or pure. Applied science is a knowledge of
facts, events, or phenomena, as explained, accounted for, or
produced, by means of powers, causes, or laws. Pure science is the
knowledge of these powers, causes, or laws, considered apart, or as
pure from all applications. Both these terms have a similar and
special signification when applied to the science of quantity; as,
the applied and pure mathematics. Exact science is knowledge so
systematized that prediction and verification, by measurement,
experiment, observation, etc., are possible. The mathematical and
physical sciences are called the exact sciences. Comparative
sciences, Inductive sciences. See under Comparative, and Inductive.
$
Syn.
-- Literature; art; knowledge.
-- Science, Literature, Art. Science is literally knowledge, but
more usually denotes a systematic and orderly arrangement of
knowledge. In a more distinctive sense, science embraces those
branches of knowledge of which the subject-matter is either ultimate
principles, or facts as explained by principles or laws thus arranged
in natural order. The term literature sometimes denotes all
compositions not embraced under science, but usually confined to the
belles-lettres. Art is that which depends on
practice and skill in performance. "In science, scimus ut sciamus; in
art, scimus ut producamus. And, therefore, science and art may be
said to be investigations of truth; but one, science, inquires for
the sake of knowledge; the other, art, for the sake of production;
and hence science is more concerned with the higher truths, art with
the lower; and science never is engaged, as art is, in productive
application. And the most perfect state of science, therefore, will
be the most high and accurate inquiry; the perfection of art will be
the most apt and efficient system of rules; art always throwing
itself into the form of rules." Karslake.

-- Self-love, Selfishness. The term self-love is used in a twofold
sense: 1. It denotes that longing for good or for well-being which
actuates the breasts of all, entering into and characterizing every
special desire. In this sense it has no moral quality, being, from
the nature of the case, neither good nor evil. 2. It is applied to a
voluntary regard for the gratification of special desires. In this
sense it is morally good or bad according as these desires are
conformed to duty or opposed to it. Selfishness is always voluntary
and always wrong, being that regard to our own interests,
gratification, etc., which is sought or indulged at the expense, and
to the injury, of others. "So long as self-love does not degenerate
into selfishness, it is quite compatible with true benevolence."

selfishness, which certainly, in strict propriety, denotes a very
different disposition of mind." Slewart.

Syn.
-- Perception.
-- Sensation, Perseption. The distinction between these words, when
used in mental philosophy, may be thus stated; if I simply smell a
rose, I have a sensation; if I refer that smell to the external
object which occasioned it, I have a perception. Thus, the former is
mere feeling, without the idea of an object; the latter is the mind's
apprehension of some external object as occasioning that feeling.
"Sensation properly expresses that change in the state of the mind
which is produced by an impression upon an organ of sense. Perception, on the other hand,
expresses the knowledge or the intimations we obtain by means of our
sensations concerning the qualities of matter, and consequently
involves, in every instance, the notion of externality, or outness,
which it is necessary to exclude in order to seize the precise import
of the word sensation." Fleming.

8.

One of two opposite directions in which a line, surface, or
volume, may be supposed to be described by the motion of a point,
line, or surface. Common sense, according to Sir W. Hamilton:
"The complement of those cognitions or convictions which we receive
from nature, which all men possess in common, and by which they test
the truth of knowledge and the morality of actions." "The faculty
of first principles." These two are the philosophical significations.
"Such ordinary complement of intelligence, that,if a person be
deficient therein, he is accounted mad or foolish." When the
substantive is emphasized: "Native practical intelligence, natural
prudence, mother wit, tact in behavior, acuteness in the observation
of character, in contrast to habits of acquired learning or of
speculation." -- Moral sense. See under Moral,.
-- The inner, or internal, sense, capacity of the mind to be aware
of its own states; consciousness; reflection. "This source of ideas

$
Syn.
-- Understanding; reason.
-- Sense, Understanding, Reason. Some philosophers have given a
technical signification to these terms, which may here be stated.
Sense is the mind's acting in the direct cognition either of material
objects or of its own mental states. In the first case it is called
the outer, in the second the inner, sense. Understanding is the
logical faculty, i. e., the power of apprehending under general
conceptions, or the power of classifying, arranging, and making
deductions. Reason is the power of apprehending those first or
fundamental truths or principles which are the conditions of all real
and scientific knowledge, and which control the mind in all its
processes of investigation and deduction. These distinctions are
given, not as established, but simply because they often occur in
writers of the present day.

$
Syn.
-- Thought; opinion; notion; sensibility; feeling.
-- Sentiment, Opinion, Feeling. An opinion is an intellectual
judgment in respect to any and every kind of truth. Feeling describes
those affections of pleasure and pain which spring from the exercise
of our sentient and emotional powers. Sentiment lies between them, denoting settled opinions or principles in
regard to subjects which interest the feelings strongly, and are
presented more or less constantly in practical life. Hence, it is
more appropriate to speak of our religious sentiments than opinions,
unless we mean to exclude all reference to our feelings. The word
sentiment, in the singular, leans ordinarily more to the side of
feeling, and denotes a refined sensibility on subjects affecting the
heart. "On questions of feeling, taste, observation, or report, we
define our sentiments. On questions of science, argument, or
metaphysical abstraction, we define our opinions. The sentiments of
the heart. The opinions of the mind... There is more of instinct
in sentiment, and more of definition in opinion. The admiration of a
work of art which results from first impressions is classed with our
sentiments; and, when we have accounted to ourselves for the
approbation, it is classed with our opinions." W. Taylor.

Nay, ev'n each moral sentimental stroke, Where not the character, but
poet, spoke, He lopped, as foreign to his chaste design, Nor spared a
useless, though a golden line. Whitehead.

2. Inclined to sentiment; having an excess of sentiment or
sensibility; indulging the sensibilities for their own sake;
artificially or affectedly tender; -- often in a reproachful sense.
A sentimental mind is rather prone to overwrought feeling and
exaggerated tenderness. Whately.

3. Addressed or pleasing to the emotions only, usually to the weaker
and the unregulated emotions.
$
Syn.
-- Romantic.
-- Sentimental, Romantic. Sentimental usually describes an error or
excess of the sensibilities; romantic, a vice of the imagination. The
votary of the former gives indulgence to his sensibilities for the
mere luxury of their excitement; the votary of the latter allows his
imagination to rove for the pleasure of creating scenes of ideal
enjoiment. "Perhaps there is no less danger in works called
sentimental. They attack the heart more successfully, because more
cautiously." V. Knox. "I can not but look on an indifferency of mind,
as to the good or evil things of this life, as a mere romantic fancy
of such who would be thought to be much wiser than they ever were, or
could be." Bp. Stillingfleet.

SHALL
Shall, v. i. & auxiliary.

[Note]

1. To owe; to be under obligation for. "By the faith I shall
to God" Court of Love.

2. To be obliged; must. "Me athinketh that I
shall rehearse it her." Chaucer.

3. As an auxiliary, shall indicates a duty or necessity whose
obligation is derived from the person speaking; as, you shall go; he
shall go; that is, I order or promise your going. It thus ordinarily
expresses, in the second and third persons, a command, a threat, or a
promise. If the auxillary be emphasized, the command is made more
imperative, the promise or that more positive and sure. It is also
employed in the language of prophecy; as, "the day shall come when.
.. , " since a promise or threat and an authoritative prophecy
nearly coincide in significance. In shall with the first person, the
necessity of the action is sometimes implied as residing elsewhere
than in the speaker; as, I shall suffer; we shall see; and there is
always a less distinct and positive assertion of his volition than is
indicated by will. "I shall go" implies nearly a simple futurity;
more exactly, a foretelling or an expectation of my going, in which,
naturally enough, a certain degree of plan or intention may be
included; emphasize the shall, and the event is described as certain
to occur, and the expression approximates in meaning to our emphatic
"I will go." In a question, the relation of speaker and source of
obligation is of course transferred to the person addressed; as,
"Shall you go" ; "Shall he go" i. e., "Do you
require or promise his going" The same
relation is transferred to either second or third person in such
phrases as "You say, or think, you shall go;" "He says, or thinks, he
shall go." After a conditional conjunction shall is
used in all persons to express futurity simply; as, if I, you, or he
shall say they are right. Should is everywhere used in the same
connection and the same senses as shall, as its imperfect. It also
expresses duty or moral obligation; as, he should do it whether he
will or not. In the early English, and hence in our English Bible,
shall is the auxiliary mainly used, in all the persons, to express
simple futurity. Shall may be used elliptically;
thus, with an adverb or other word expressive of motion go may be
omitted. "He to England shall along with you." Shak.

[Note] Shall and will are often confounded by inaccurate speakers and
writers. Say: I shall be glad to see you. Shall I do this Shall I
help you See Will.

Syn.
-- Glistening; bright; radiant; resplendent; effulgent; lustrous;

-- Shining, Brilliant, Sparking. Shining describes the steady
emission of a strong light, or the steady reflection of light from a
clear or polished surface. Brilliant denotes a shining of great
brightness, but with gleams or flashes. Sparkling implies a fitful,
intense shining from radiant points or sparks, by which the eye is
dazzled. The same distinctions obtain when these epithets are
figuratively applied. A man of shining talents is made conspicious by
possessing them; if they flash upon the mind with a peculiarly
striking effect, we call them brilliant; if his brilliancy is marked
by great vivacity and occasional intensity, he is sparkling.

All this criticism proceeds upon the erroneous hypothesis
that he was a dogmatist. He was a skeptic; that is, he accepted the
principles asserted by the prevailing dogmatism: and only showed that
such and such conclusions were, on these principles, inevitable. Sir
W. Hamilton.

3. A person who doubts the existence and perfections of God, or
the truth of revelation; one who disbelieves the divine origin of the
Christian religion.
Suffer not your faith to be shaken by the sophistries of skeptics. S.
Clarke.

[Note] This word and its derivatives are often written with c instead
of k in the first syllable, -- sceptic, sceptical, scepticism, etc.
Dr. Johnson, struck with the extraordinary irregularity of giving c
its hard sound before e, altered the spelling, and his example has
been followed by most of the lexicographers who have succeeded him;
yet the prevalent practice among English writers and printers is in
favor of the other mode. In the United States this practice is
reversed, a large and increasing majority of educated persons
preferring the orthography which is most in accordance with etymology
and analogy.

man is skillful in any employment when he understands both its theory
and its practice. He is dexterous when he maneuvers with great
lightness. He is adroit in the use od quick, sudden, and well-
directed movements of the body or the mind, so as to effect the
object he has in view.

SOAP
Soap, n.

A substance which dissolves in water, thus forming a lather,

or oils with alkalies or alkaline earths, usually by boiling, and
consists of salts of sodium, potassium, etc., with the fatty acids
. See the Note below, and cf.

properties, whether used as a cleaning agent or not.

[Note] In general, soaps are of two classes, hard and soft. Calcium,
magnesium, lead, etc., form soaps, but they are insoluble and
useless.
The purifying action of soap depends upon the fact that it is
decomposed by a large quantity of water into free alkali and an
insoluble acid salt. The first of these takes away the fatty dirt on
washing, and the latter forms the soap lather which envelops the
greasy matter and thus tends to remove it. Roscoe & Schorlemmer.

alone; seclusion, that he is shut out from others, usually by his own
choice; loneliness, that he feels the pain and oppression of being

solitude, to society; seclusion, to freedom of access on the part of
others; and loneliness, enjoyment of that society which the heart
demands.

afterwards. The syllable do is often substituted for ut.

regained by evaporation, as in the solution of salt or sugar in
water. Chemical solution, in which there is involved a decided
chemical change, as when limestone or zinc undergoes solution in
hydrochloric acid. Mechanical solution is regarded as a form of
molecular or atomic attraction, and is probably occasioned by the
formation of certain very weak and unstable compounds which are
easily dissociated and pass into new and similar compounds.

[Note] This word is not used in chemistry or mineralogy for fusion, or
the melting of bodies by the heat of fire.

3. In science, a more or less permanent group of existing things or
beings, associated according to attributes, or properties determined
by scientific observation.

[Note] In mineralogy and chemistry, objects which possess the same
definite chemical structure, and are fundamentally the same in
crystallization and physical characters, are classed as belonging to
a species. In zoölogy and botany, a species is an ideal group of
individuals which are believed to have descended from common
ancestors, which agree in essential characteristics, and are capable
of indefinitely continued fertile reproduction through the sexes. A
species, as thus defined, differs from a variety or subspecies only
in the greater stability of its characters and in the absence of
individuals intermediate between the related groups.

seeds, bulbs, and tubers, and extracted as a white, glistening, granular or powdery substance,
without taste or smell, and giving a very peculiar creaking sound
when rubbed between the fingers. It is used as a food, in the
production of commercial grape sugar, for stiffening linen in
laundries, in making paste, etc.

[Note] Starch is a carbohydrate, being the typical amylose, C6H10O5,
and is detected by the fine blue color given to it by free iodine. It
is not fermentable as such, but is changed by diastase into dextrin
and maltose, and by heating with dilute acids into dextrose. Cf.
Sugar, Inulin, and Lichenin.

2. Fig.: A stiff, formal manner; formality. Addison. Starch hyacinth
, the grape hyacinth; -- so called because the flowers have the

STEAM ENGINE
Steam" en"gine.

An engine moved by steam.

[Note] In its most common forms its essential parts are a piston, a
cylinder, and a valve gear. The piston works in the cylinder, to
which steam is admitted by the action of the valve gear, and
communicates motion to the machinery to be actuated. Steam engines
are thus classified: 1. According to the wat the steam is used or
applied, as condencing, noncondencing, compound, double-acting,
single-acting, triple-expansion, etc. 2. According to the motion of
the piston, as reciprocating, rotary, etc. 3. According to the motion
imparted by the engine, as rotative and nonrotative. 4. According to
the arrangement of the engine, as stationary, portable, and
semiportable engines, beam engine, oscillating engine, direct-acting
and back-acting engines, etc. 5. According to their uses, as
portable, marine, locomotive, pumping, blowing, winding, and
stationary engines. Locomotive and portable engines are usually high-
pressure, noncondencing, rotative, and direct-acting. Marine engines
are high or low pressure, rotative, and generally condencing, double-
acting, and compound. Paddle engines are generally beam, sideScrew
engines are generally direct-acting, back-acting, or oscillating.
Stationary engines belong to various classes, but are generally
rotative. A horizontal or inclined stationary steam engine is called
a left-hand or a right-hand engine when the crank shaft and driving
pulley are on the left-hand side, or the right-hand side,
respectively, or the engine, to a person looking at them from the
cylinder, and is said to run forward or backward when the crank
traverses the upward half, or lower half, respectively, of its path,
while the piston rod makes its stroke outward from the cylinder. A
marine engine, or the engine of a locomotive, is said to run forward
when its motion is such as would propel the vessel or the locomotive
forward. Steam engines are further classified as double-cylinder,
disk, semicylinder, trunk engines, etc. Machines, such as cranes,
hammers, etc., of which the steam engine forms a part, are called
steam cranes, steam hammers, etc. See Illustration in Appendix. Back-
acting, or Back-action, steam engine, a steam engine in which the
motion is transmitted backward from the crosshead to a crank which is
between the crosshead and the cylinder, or beyond the cylinder.
-- Portable steam engine, a steam engine combined with, and attached
to, a boiler which is mounted on wheels so as to admit of easy
transportation; -- used for driving machinery in the field, as
trashing machines, draining pumps, etc.
-- Semiportable steam engine, a steam engine combined with, and
attached to, a steam boiler, but not mounted on wheels.

words is the same, namely, a mingled emotion of astonishment and awe.
In speaking of the quality which produces this emotion, we call it
grandeur when it springs from what is vast in space, power, etc.; we
call it sublimity when it springs from what is elevated far above the
ordinary incidents of humanity. An immense plain is grand. The
heavens are not only grand, but sublime , from their immense height. Exalted intellect, and
especially exalted virtue under severe trials, give us the sense of
moral sublimity, as in the case of our Savior in his prayer for his
murderers. We do not speak of Satan, when standing by the fiery gulf,
with his "unconquerable will and study of revenge," as a sublime
object; but there is a melancholy grandeur thrown around him, as of
an "archangel ruined."

In a more general sense, it includes several distinct chemical
compounds, as the glucoses, or grape sugars , and the sucroses, or true sugars. All sugars are carbohydrates. See Carbohydrate. The
glucoses, or grape sugars, are ketone alcohols of the formula
C6H12O6, and they turn the plane of polarization to the right or the
left. They are produced from the amyloses and sucroses, as by the
action of heat and acids of ferments, and are themselves decomposed
by fermentation into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The only sugar
as yet produced artificially belongs to this class.
The sucroses, or cane sugars, are doubled glucose anhydrides of the
formula C12H22O11. They are usually not fermentable as such , and they act on polarized light.

substance having a sweet taste.

most commonly domesticated, bends its neck in an S-shaped curve. The

however, is now more commonly applied to a fellow-feeling with others
under affliction, and then coincides very nearly with commiseration.
In this case it is commonly followed by for; as, to feel sympathy for
a friend when we see him distressed. The verb sympathize is followed
by with; as, to sympathize with a friend in his distresses or
enjoyments. "Every man would be a distinct species to himself, were
there no sympathy among individuals." South. See Pity.
Fault, Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought Commiseration.

$
Syn.
-- Identical; interchangeable.
-- Synonymous, Identical. If no words are synonymous except those
which are identical in use and meaning, so that the one can in all
cases be substituted for the other, we have scarcely ten such words
in our language. But the term more properly denotes that the words in
question approach so near to each other, that, in many or most cases,
they can be used interchangeably. 1. Words may thus coincide in
certain connections, and so be interchanged, when they can not be
interchanged in other connections; thus we may speak either strength
of mind or of force of mind, but we say the force of
gravitation. 2. Two words may differ slightly, but this difference
may be unimportant to the speaker's object, so that he may freely
interchange them; thus it makes but little difference, in most cases,
whether we speak of a man's having secured his object or having
attained his object. For these and other causes we have numerous
words which may, in many cases or connections, be used
interchangeably, and these are properly called synonyms. Synonymous
words "are words which, with great and essential resemblances of
meaning, have, at the same time, small, subordinate, and partial
differences, -- these differences being such as either originally and
on the ground of their etymology inhered in them; or differences
which they have by usage acquired in the eyes of all; or such as,
though nearly latent now, they are capable of receiving at the hands
of wise and discreet masters of the tongue. Synonyms are words of
like significance in the main, but with a certain unlikeness as
well." Trench.
