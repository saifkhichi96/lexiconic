such cases, that laid is the preterit of lay, and not of lie. To lie

LIGHT
Light, n.

1. That agent, force, or action in nature by the operation of which
upon the organs of sight, objects are rendered visible or luminous.

Note: Light was regarded formerly as consisting of material
particles, or corpuscules, sent off in all directions from luminous
bodies, and traversing space, in right lines, with the known velocity
of about 186,300 miles per second; but it is now generally understood
to consist, not in any actual transmission of particles or substance,
but in the propagation of vibrations or undulations in a subtile,
elastic medium, or ether, assumed to pervade all space, and to be
thus set in vibratory motion by the action of luminous bodies, as the
atmosphere is by sonorous bodies. This view of the nature of light is
known as the undulatory or wave theory; the other, advocated by
Newton, as the corpuscular, emission, or
Newtonian theory. A more recent theory makes light to consist in
electrical oscillations, and is known as the electro-magnetic theory
of light.

5. The medium through which light is admitted, as a window, or window
pane; a skylight; in architecture, one of the compartments of a
window made by a mullion or mullions.

three ranks. I Kings vii.4. 6. Life; existence.

7. Open view; a visible state or condition; public observation;

bring them to light..

from me. Ps. xxxviii. 10.

9. That which illumines or makes clear to the mind; mental or
spiritual illumination; enlightenment; knowledge; information.

Log, n.

$
LOG
Log, n.

1. A bulky piece of wood which has not been shaped by hewing or
sawing.

2. An apparatus for measuring the rate of a ship's motion through
the water.

Note: The common log consists of the log-chip, or logship, often
exclusively called the log, and the log line, the former being
commonly a thin wooden quadrant of five or six inches radius, loaded
with lead on the arc to make it float with the point up. It is
attached to the log line by cords from each corner. This line is
divided into equal spaces, called knots, each bearing the same
proportion to a mile that half a minute does to an hour. The line is
wound on a reel which is so held as to let it run off freely. When
the log is thrown, the log-chip is kept by the water from being drawn
forward, and the speed of the ship is shown by the number of knots
run out in half a minute. There are improved logs, consisting of a
piece of mechanism which, being towed astern, shows the distance
actually gone through by the ship, by means of the revolutions of a
fly, which are registered on a dial plate.

3. Hence: The record of the rate of ship's speed or of her daily
progress; also, the full nautical record of a ship's cruise or
voyage; a log slate; a log book.

LOGAOEDIC
Log`a*oed"ic, a.

One of a class of auxiliary numbers, devised by John Napier, of
Merchiston, Scotland, to abridge arithmetical
calculations, by the use of addition and subtraction in place of
multiplication and division.

Note: The relation of logarithms to common numbers is that of numbers
in an arithmetical series to corresponding numbers in a geometrical
series, so that sums and differences of the former indicate
respectively products and quotients of the latter; thus
0 1 2 3 4 Indices or logarithms 1 10 100 1000 10,000 Numbers in
geometrical progression Hence, the logarithm of any given number is
the exponent of a power to which another given invariable number,
called the base, must be raised in order to produce that given
number. Thus, let 10 be the base, then 2 is the logarithm of 100,
because 102 = 100, and 3 is the logarithm of 1,000, because 103 =
1,000. Arithmetical complement of a logarithm, the difference between
a logarithm and the number ten.
-- Binary logarithms. See under Binary.
-- Common logarithms, or Brigg's logarithms, logarithms of which the
base is 10; -- so called from Henry Briggs, who invented them.
-- Gauss's logarithms, tables of logarithms constructed for
facilitating the operation of finding the logarithm of the sum of
difference of two quantities from the logarithms of the quantities,
one entry of those tables and two additions or subtractions answering
the purpose of three entries of the common tables and one addition or
subtraction. They were suggested by the celebrated German
mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss, and are of great
service in many astronomical computations.
-- Hyperbolic, or Napierian, logarithms, those logarithms of which the base is 2.7182818; -- so called
from Napier, the inventor of logarithms.

connection with the esophagus becomes elongated into the windpipe and
the inner walls of the sacs become more and more divided, until, in
the mammals, the air spaces become minutely divided into tubes ending
in small air cells, in the walls of which the blood circulates in a
fine network of capillaries. In mammals the lungs are more or less
divided into lobes, and each lung occupies a separate cavity in the
thorax. See Respiration. Lung fever, pneumonia.
