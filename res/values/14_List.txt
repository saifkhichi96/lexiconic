N
N, the fourteenth letter of English alphabet, is a vocal consonant, and, in allusion to its mode of formation, is called the dentinasal or lingua-nasal consonant. Its commoner sound is that heard in ran, done; but when immediately followed in the same word by the sound of g hard or k (as in single, sink, conquer), it usually represents the same sound as the digraph ng in sing, bring, etc. This is a simple but related sound, and is called the gutturo-nasal consonant. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 243-246. The letter N came into English through the Latin and Greek from the Phoenician, which probably derived it from the Egyptian as the ultimate origin. It is etymologically most closely related to M. See M.

NOTWITHSTANDING
Not`with*stand"ing, prep.

Without prevention, or obstruction from or by; in spite of.
We gentil women bee Loth to displease any wight, Notwithstanding our
great right. 's Dream.
Those on whom Christ bestowed miraculous cures were so transported
that their gratitude made them, notwithstanding his prohibition,
proclaim the wonders he had done. Dr. H. More.

[Note] Notwithstanding was, by Johnson and Webster, viewed as a
participle absolute, an English equivalent of the Latin non obstante.
Its several meanings, either as preposition, adverb, or conjunction,
are capable of being explained in this view. Later grammarians, while
admitting that the word was originally a participle, and can be
treated as such, prefer to class it as a preposition or disjunctive
conjunction.

Syn.
 -- In spite of; despite.
 -- Notwithstanding, In spite of, Despite. These words and phrases
are often interchanged, but there is a difference between them,
chiefly in strength. Notwithstanding is the weaker term, and simply
points to some obstacle that may exist; as, I shall go,
notwithstanding the rain. In spite or despite of has reference
primarily to active opposition to be encountered from others; as,
"I'll be, in man's despite, a monarch; " "I'll keep mine own, despite
of all the world." Shak. Hence, these words, when applied to things,
suppose greater opposition than notwithstanding. We should say. "He
was thrust rudely out of doors in spite of his entreaties," rather
than "notwithstanding". On the other hand, it would be more civil to
say, "Notwithstanding all you have said, I must still differ with
you."

withstand, with not prefixed.]
