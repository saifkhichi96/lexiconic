mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles and when transferred to
the blood of man, by the bite of the mosquito, produce malaria. The
young parasites, or sporozoites, enter the red blood corpuscles,
growing at their expense, undergoing sporulation, and finally
destroying the corpuscles, thus liberating in the blood plasma an
immense number of small spores called merozoites. An indefinite but
not ultimated number of such generations may follow, but if meanwhile
the host is bitten by a mosquito, the parasites develop into gametes
in the stomach of the insect. These conjugate, the zygote thus
produced divides, forming spores, and eventually sporozoites, which,
penetrating to the salivary glands of the mosquito, may be introduced
into a new host. The attacks of the disease coincide with the
dissolution of the corpuscles and liberation of the spores and
products of growth of the parasites into the blood plasma. Several
species of the parasite are distinguished, as P. vivax, producing
tertian malaria; P. malariae, quartan malaria; and P. falciferum, the malarial fever of summer and autumn common
in the tropics.

photographed.

mechanics includes the action of forces on all bodies, whether solid,

bodies is called also hydrostatics, or hydrodynamics, according as

useful results, constitutes hydraulics. Animal mechanics,
that portion of physiology which has for its object the investigation
of the laws of equilibrium and motion in the animal body. The most

forming the arms of the levers, the contractile muscles the power,
the joints the fulcra or points of support, while the weight of the
body or of the individual limbs constitutes the weight or resistance.

Syn.
-- Memory, Remembrance, Recollection, Reminiscence. Memory is the
generic term, denoting the power by which we reproduce past
impressions. Remembrance is an exercise of that power when things
occur spontaneously to our thoughts. In recollection we make a
distinct effort to collect again, or call back, what we know has been
formerly in the mind. Reminiscence is intermediate between
remembrance and recollection, being a conscious process of recalling
past occurrences, but without that full and varied reference to
particular things which characterizes recollection. "When an idea
again recurs without the operation of the like object on the external
sensory, it is remembrance; if it be sought after by the mind, and
with pain and endeavor found, and brought again into view, it is
recollection." Locke. To draw to memory, to put on record; to record.
Gower.

MENDELIAN CHARACTER
Mendelian character.

A character which obeys Mendel's law in regard to its
hereditary transmission.
$
MENDEL'S LAW
Men"del's law.

A principle governing the inheritance of many characters in
animals and plants, discovered by Gregor J. Mendel in breeding experiments with peas. He
showed that the height, color, and other characters depend on the
presence of determinating factors behaving as units. In any given
germ cell each of these is either present or absent. The following
example shows the operation of
the law: Tallness being due to a factor T, a tall plant, arising by
the union in fertilization of two germ cells both bearing this
factor, is TT; a dwarf, being without T, is tt. Crossing these,
crossbreeds, Tt, result. In the formation of
the germ cells of these crossbreeds a process of segregation occurs
such that germ cells, whether male or female, are produced of two
kinds, T and t, in equal numbers. The T cells bear the factor
"tallness," the t cells are devoid of it. The offspring, generation
F2, which arise from the chance union of these germ cells in pairs,
according to the law of probability, are therefore on an average in
the following proportions:

1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt;

and thus plants pure in tallness and dwarfness, as well as
crossbreeds, are formed by the interbreeding of crossbreeds.
Frequently, as in this example, owning to what is called the
dominance of a factor, the operation of Mendel's law may be
complicated by the fact that when a dominant factor occurs
with its allelomorph, called recessive, in the crossbreed Tt,
the individual Tt is itself indistinguishable from the pure form TT.
Generation F1, containing only the Tt form, consists entirely of
dominants and generation F2 consists of three dominants
to one dwarf, which, displaying the feature
suppressed in F1, is called recessive. Such qualitative and numerical
regularity has been proved to exist in regard to very diverse
qualities or characters which compose living things, both wild and
domesticated, such as colors of flowers, of hair or eyes, patterns,
structure, chemical composition, and power of resisting certain
diseases. The diversity of forms produced in crossbreeding by
horticulturists and fanciers generally results from a process of
analytical variation or recombination of the factors composing the
parental types. Purity of type consequently acquires a specific
meaning. An individual is pure in respect of a given character when
it results from the union of two sexual cells both bearing that
character, or both without it.

Met`a*phys"ics, n.

1. The science of real as distinguished from phenomenal being;

and universal conditions, as distinguished from the science of
determined or concrete being; the science of the conceptions and
relations which are necessarily implied as true of every kind of
being; phylosophy in general; first principles, or the science of
first principles.

Note: Metaphysics is distinguished as general and special. General
metaphysics is the science of all being as being. Special metaphysics
is the science of one kind of being; as, the metaphysics of
chemistry, of morals, or of politics. According to Kant, a systematic
exposition of those notions and truths, the knowledge of which is
altogether independent of experience, would constitute the science of
metaphysics.
Commonly, in the schools, called metaphysics, as being part of the
philosophy of Aristotle, which hath that for title; but it is in
another sense: for there it signifieth as much as "books written or
placed after his natural philosophy." But the schools take them for
"books of supernatural philosophy;" for the word metaphysic will bear
both these senses. Hobbes.
Now the science conversant about all such inferences of unknown being
from its known manifestations, is called ontology, or metaphysics
proper. Sir W. Hamilton.
Metaphysics are the science which determines what can and what
can not be known of being, and the laws of being, a priori.
Coleridge.

2. Hence: The scientific knowledge of mental phenomena; mental
philosophy; psychology.
Metaphysics, in whatever latitude the term be taken, is a science or
complement of sciences exclusively occupied with mind. Sir W.
Hamilton.
Whether, after all, A larger metaphysics might not help Our physics.

of f and x + y, and the operation indicated by f is called

substance, protoplasmic nuclei, the so-called muscle corpuscles. The
nonstriated muscles are involuntary. They constitute a large part of
the walls of the alimentary canal, blood vessels, uterus, and
bladder, and are found also in the iris, skin, etc. They are made up
of greatly elongated cells, usually grouped in bundles or sheets.
