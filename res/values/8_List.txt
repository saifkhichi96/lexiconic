Syn.
-- Handsome, Pretty. Pretty applies to things comparatively small,
which please by their delicacy and grace; as, a pretty girl, a pretty
flower, a pretty cottage. Handsome rises higher, and is applied to
objects on a larger scale. We admire what is handsome, we are pleased
with what is pretty. The word is connected with hand, and has thus
acquired the idea of training, cultivation, symmetry, and proportion,
which enters so largely into our conception of handsome. Thus Drayton
makes mention of handsome players, meaning those, who are well
trained; and hence we speak of a man's having a handsome address,
which is the result of culture; of a handsome horse or dog, which
implies well proportioned limbs; of a handsome face, to which, among
other qualities, the idea of proportion and a graceful contour are
essential; of a handsome tree, and a handsome house or villa. So,
from this idea of proportion or suitableness, we have, with a
different application, the expressions, a handsome fortune, a
handsome offer.

-- To Hate, Abhor, Detest, Abominate, Loathe. Hate is the generic
word, and implies that one is inflamed with extreme dislike. We abhor
what is deeply repugnant to our sensibilities or feelings. We detest
what contradicts so utterly our principles and moral sentiments that
we feel bound to lift up our voice against it. What we abominate does
equal violence to our moral and religious sentiments. What we loathe
is offensive to our own nature, and excites unmingled disgust. Our
Savior is said to have hated the deeds of the Nicolaitanes; his
language shows that he loathed the lukewarmness of the Laodiceans; he
detested the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees; he abhorred the
suggestions of the tempter in the wilderness.

Note: In adult mammals and birds, the heart is four-chambered, the

auricle and ventricle; and the blood flows from the systematic veins
to the right auricle, thence to the right ventricle, from which it is
forced to the lungs, then returned to the left auricle, thence passes
to the left ventricle, from which it is driven into the systematic
arteries. See Illust. under Aorta. In fishes there are but one
auricle and one ventricle, the blood being pumped from the ventricle
through the gills to the system, and thence returned to the auricle.
In most amphibians and reptiles, the separation of the auricles is

in many amphibians, reptiles, and birds, are contractile sacs, which
pump the lymph into the veins.

HELMET-SHAPED
Hel"met-shaped` to get up; to assist in rising, as
after a fall, and the like. "A man is well holp up that trusts to
you.".

Syn.
-- To aid; assist; succor; relieve; serve; support; sustain;
befriend.
-- To Help, Aid, Assist. These words all agree in the idea of
affording relief or support to a person under difficulties. Help
turns attention especially to the source of relief. If I fall into a
pit, I call for help; and he who helps me out does it by an act of
his own. Aid turns attention to the other side, and supposes
coöperation on the part of him who is relieved; as, he aided me in
getting out of the pit; I got out by the aid of a ladder which he
brought. Assist has a primary reference to relief afforded by a
person who "stands by" in order to relieve. It denotes both help and
aid. Thus, we say of a person who is weak, I assisted him upstairs,
or, he mounted the stairs by my assistance. When help is used as a
noun, it points less distinctively and exclusively to the source of
relief, or, in other words, agrees more closely with aid. Thus we
say, I got out of a pit by the help of my friend.

Gallantry. Courage is generic, denoting fearlessness or defiance of
danger; fortitude is passive courage, the habit of bearing up nobly
under trials, danger, and sufferings; bravery is courage displayed in
daring acts; valor is courage in battle or other conflicts with
living opponents; intrepidity is firm courage, which shrinks not amid
the most appalling dangers; gallantry is adventurous courage, dashing
into the thickest of the fight. Heroism may call into exercise all
these modifications of courage. It is a contempt of danger, not from
ignorance or inconsiderate levity, but from a noble devotion to some
great cause, and a just confidence of being able to meet danger in
the spirit of such a cause. Cf. Courage.

HORSE
Horse, n.

1.
A hoofed quadruped of the genus Equus; especially, the domestic
horse, which was domesticated in Egypt and Asia at a
very early period. It has six broad molars, on each side of each jaw,
with six incisors, and two canine teeth, both above and below. The
mares usually have the canine teeth rudimentary or wanting. The horse
differs from the true asses, in having a long, flowing mane, and the
tail bushy to the base. Unlike the asses it has callosities, or
chestnuts, on all its legs. The horse excels in strength, speed,
docility, courage, and nobleness of character, and is used for
drawing, carrying, bearing a rider, and like purposes.

Note: Many varieties, differing in form, size, color, gait, speed,
etc., are known, but all are believed to have been derived from the
same original species. It is supposed to have been a native of the
plains of Central Asia, but the wild species from which it was
derived is not certainly known. The feral horses of America are
domestic horses that have run wild; and it is probably true that most
of those of Asia have a similar origin. Some of the true wild Asiatic
horses do, however, approach the domestic horse in several
characteristics. Several species of fossil are known from the
later Tertiary formations of Europe and America. The fossil species
of other genera of the family Equidæ are also often called horses, in
general sense.

2. The male of the genus horse, in distinction from the female or
male; usually, a castrated male.

3. Mounted soldiery; cavalry; -- used without the plural termination;
as, a regiment of horse; -- distinguished from foot.
The armies were appointed, consisting of twenty-five thousand horse
and foot. Bacon.

4. A frame with legs, used to support something; as, a clotheshorse,
a sawhorse, etc.

5. A frame of timber, shaped like a horse, on which soldiers were
made to ride for punishment.

6. Anything, actual or figurative, on which one rides as on a horse;
a hobby.

7.
A mass of earthy matter, or rock of the same character as the
wall rock, occurring in the course of a vein, as of coal or ore;
hence, to take horse -- said of a vein -- is to divide into branches
for a distance.

8.

a better way. Dryden.

Syn.
-- However, At least, Nevertheless, Yet. These words, as here
compared, have an adversative sense in reference to something
referred to in the context. However is the most general, and leads to
a final conclusion or decision. Thus we say, the truth, however, has
not yet fully come out; i.e., such is the speaker's conclusion in
view of the whole case. So also we say, however, you may rely on my
assistance to that amount; i. e., at all events, whatever may happen,
this is my final decision. At least is adversative in another way. It
points out the utmost concession that can possibly be required, and
still marks the adversative conclusion; as, at least, this must be
done; whatever may be our love of peace, we must at least maintain
the rights of conscience. Nevertheless denotes that though the
concession be fully made, it has no bearing of the question; as,
nevertheless, we must go forward. Yet signifies that however extreme
the supposition or fact comceded may be, the consequence which might
naturally be expected does not and will not follow; as, though I
should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee; though he slay me,
yet will I trust in him. Cf. But.

-- Lowliness; humbleness; meekness; modesty; diffidence.
-- Humility, Modesty, Diffidence. Diffidence is a distrust of our
powers, combined with a fear lest our failure should be censured,
since a dread of failure unconnected with a dread of censure is not
usually called diffidence. It may be carried too far, and is not
always, like modesty and humility, a virtue. Modesty, without
supposing self-distrust, implies an unwillingness to put ourselves
forward, and an absence of all over-confidence in our own powers.
Humility consists in rating our claims low, in being willing to waive
our rights, and take a lower place than might be our due. It does not
require of us to underrate ourselves.
