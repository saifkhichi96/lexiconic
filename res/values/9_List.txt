I

1. I, the ninth letter of the English alphabet, takes its form from the Phoenician, through the Latin and the Greek. The Phoenician letter was probably of Egyptian origin. Its original value was nearly the same as that of the Italian I, or long e as in mete. Etymologically I is most closely related to e, y, j, g; as in dint, dent, beverage, L. bibere; E. kin, AS. cynn; E. thin, AS. ynne; E. dominion, donjon, dungeon. In English I has two principal vowel sounds: the long sound, as in pine, ice; and the short sound, as in pîn. It has also three other sounds: that of e in term, as in thirst. That of e in mete, as in machine, pique, regime. That of consonant y, as in bunion, million, filial, Christian, etc. It enters into several digraphs, as in fail, field, seize, feign, friend; and with o often forms a proper diphthong, as in oil, join, coin.

Note: The dot which we place over the small or lower case i dates only from the 14th century. The sounds of I and J were originally represented by the same character, and even after the introduction of the form J into English dictionaries, words containing these letters were, till a comparatively recent time, classed together.

2. In our old authors, I was often used for ay, yes, which is pronounced nearly like it.

3. As a numeral, I stands for 1, II for 2, etc.

IMAGINATION
Im*ag`i*na"tion, n.

1. The imagine-making power of the mind; the power to create or
reproduce ideally an object of sense previously perceived; the power
to call up mental imagines.
Our simple apprehension of corporeal objects, if present, is sense;
if absent, is imagination. Glanvill.
Imagination is of three kinds: joined with belief of that which is to
come; joined with memory of that which is past; and of things
present, or as if they were present. Bacon.

2. The representative power; the power to reconstruct or recombine
the materials furnished by direct apprehension; the complex faculty
usually termed the plastic or creative power; the fancy.
The imagination of common language -- the productive imagination of
philosophers -- is nothing but the representative process plus the
process to which I would give the name of the "comparative." Sir W.
Hamilton.
The power of the mind to decompose its conceptions, and to recombine
the elements of them at its pleasure, is called its faculty of
imagination. I. Taylor.
The business of conception is to present us with an exact transcript
of what we have felt or perceived. But we have moreover a power of
modifying our conceptions, by combining the parts of different ones
together, so as to form new wholes of our creation. I shall employ
the word imagination to express this power. Stewart.

3. The power to recombine the materials furnished by experience or
memory, for the accomplishment of an elevated purpose; the power of
conceiving and expressing the ideal.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are of imagination all compact.
. The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven
to earth, from earth to heaven, And as imagination bodies forth The
forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes, and
gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name..

4. A mental image formed by the action of the imagination as a
faculty; a conception; a notion..

Syn.
-- Conception; idea; conceit; fancy; device; origination; invention;
scheme; design; purpose; contrivance.
-- Imagination, Fancy. These words have, to a great extent, been
interchanged by our best writers, and considered as strictly
synonymous. A distinction, however, is now made between them which
more fully exhibits their nature. Properly speaking, they are
different exercises of the same general power -- the plastic or
creative faculty. Imagination consists in taking parts of our
conceptions and combining them into new forms and images more select,
more striking, more delightful, more terrible, etc., than those of
ordinary nature. It is the higher exercise of the two. It creates by
laws more closely connected with the reason; it has strong emotion as
its actuating and formative cause; it aims at results of a definite
and weighty character. Milton's fiery lake, the debates of his
Pandemonium, the exquisite scenes of his Paradise, are all products
of the imagination. Fancy moves on a lighter wing; it is governed by
laws of association which are more remote, and sometimes arbitrary or
capricious. Hence the term fanciful, which exhibits fancy in its
wilder flights. It has for its actuating spirit feelings of a lively,
gay, and versatile character; it seeks to please by unexpected
combinations of thought, startling contrasts, flashes of brilliant
imagery, etc. Pope's Rape of the Lock is an exhibition of fancy which
has scarcely its equal in the literature of any country.
-- "This, for instance, Wordworth did in respect of the words
`imagination' and `fancy.' Before he wrote, it was, I suppose,
obscurely felt by most that in `imagination' there was more of the
earnest, in `fancy' of the play of the spirit; that the first was a
loftier faculty and gift than the second; yet for all this words were
continually, and not without loss, confounded. He first, in the
preface to his Lyrical Ballads, rendered it henceforth impossible
that any one, who had read and mastered what he has written on the
two words, should remain unconscious any longer of the important
difference between them." Trench.
The same power, which we should call fancy if employed on a
production of a light nature, would be dignified with the title of
imagination if shown on a grander scale. C. J. Smith.

the popes, it was extensively used in the ecclesiastical chronology
of the Middle Ages. The number of indictions was reckoned at first
from 312 a. d., but since the twelfth century it has been reckoned
from the birth of Christ. The papal indiction is the only one ever
used at the present day. To find the indiction and year of the
indiction by the first method, subtract 312 from the given year a.
d., and divide by 15; by the second method, add 3 to the given year
a. d., and the divide by 15. In either case, the quotient is the
number of the current indiction, and the remainder the year of the
indiction. See Cycle of indiction, under Cycle.

autochthonous Negritos were largely expelled by the Caucasian
Polynesians, themselves followed by Mongoloid peoples of Indo-Chinese
affinities, from mixture with whom sprang the Indonesian race.

The term Indonesian, introduced by Logan to designate the light-
colored non-Malay inhabitants of the Eastern Archipelago, is now used
as a convenient collective name for all the peoples of Malaysia and
Polynesia who are neither Malay nor Papuans, but of Caucasic type..
. The true Indonesians are of tall stature, muscular
frame, rather oval features, high, open forehead, large straight or
curved nose, large full eyes always horizontal and with no trace of
the third lid, light brown complexion, long
black hair, not lank but often slightly curled or wavy, skull
generally brachycephalous like that of the melanochroic European.
A. H. Keane.

The Indonesians, with the tribal population of
some 251, 200, live almost exclusively on the great island of
Mindanao. They are not only physically superior to the Negritos, but
to the peoples of the Malayan race as well, and are, as a rule, quite
intelligent.

that what has been observed or established in respect to a part,
individual, or species, may, on the ground of analogy, be affirmed or
received of the whole to which it belongs. This last is the inductive
method of Bacon. It ascends from the parts to the whole, and forms,
from the general analogy of nature, or special presumptions in the
case, conclusions which have greater or less degrees of force, and
which may be strengthened or weakened by subsequent experience and
experiment. It relates to actual existences, as in physical science
or the concerns of life. Logical induction is founded on the
necessary laws of thought; philosophical induction, on the
interpretation of the indications or analogy of nature.

Syn.
-- Deduction.
-- Induction, Deduction. In induction we observe a sufficient number
of individual facts, and, on the ground of analogy, extend what is
true of them to others of the same class, thus arriving at general
principles or laws. This is the kind of reasoning in physical
science. In deduction we begin with a general truth, which is already
proven or provisionally assumed, and seek to connect it with some
particular case by means of a middle term, or class of objects, known
to be equally connected with both. Thus, we bring down the general
into the particular, affirming of the latter the distinctive
qualities of the former. This is the syllogistic method. By induction
Franklin established the identity of lightning and electricity; by
deduction he inferred that dwellings might be protected by lightning
rods.

These inferences, or conclusions, are the effects of reasoning, and
the three propositions, taken all together, are called syllogism, or
argument. I. Watts.

Syn.
-- Conclusion; deduction; consequence.
-- Inference, Conclusion. An inference is literally that which is
brought in; and hence, a deduction or induction from premises, --
something which follows as certainly or probably true. A conclusion
is stronger than an inference; it shuts us up to the result, and
terminates inquiry. We infer what is particular or probable; we
conclude what is certain. In a chain of reasoning we have many
inferences, which lead to the ultimate conclusion. "An inference is a
proposition which is perceived to be true, because of its connection
with some known fact." "When something is simply affirmed to be true,
it is called a proposition; after it has been found to be true by
several reasons or arguments, it is called a conclusion." I. Taylor.

authority of Christianity; a Mohammedan; a heathen; a freethinker.

Note: Infidel is used by English writers to translate the equivalent
word used Mohammedans in speaking of Christians and other
disbelievers in Mohammedanism.

Syn.
-- Infidel, Unbeliever, Freethinker, Deist, Atheist, Sceptic,
Agnostic. An infidel, in common usage, is one who denies Christianity
and the truth of the Scriptures. Some have endeavored to widen the
sense of infidel so as to embrace atheism and every form of unbelief;
but this use does not generally prevail. A freethinker is now only
another name for an infidel. An unbeliever is not necessarily a
disbeliever or infidel, because he may still be inquiring after
evidence to satisfy his mind; the word, however, is more commonly
used in the extreme sense. A deist believes in one God and a divine
providence, but rejects revelation. An atheist denies the being of
God. A sceptic is one whose faith in the credibility of evidence is
weakened or destroyed, so that religion, to the same extent, has no
practical hold on his mind. An agnostic remains in a state of
suspended judgment, neither affirming nor denying the existence of a
personal Deity.

INFINITIVE
In*fin"i*tive, n.
Unlimited; not bounded or restricted; undefined. Infinitive
mood, that form of the verb which merely names the action,
and performs the office of a verbal noun. Some grammarians make two
forms in English: The simple form, as, speak, go, hear, before
which to is commonly placed, as, to speak; to go; to hear. The
form of the imperfect participle, called the infinitive in -ing; as,
going is as easy as standing.

Note: With the auxiliary verbs may, can, must, might, could, would,
and should, the simple infinitive is expressed without to; as, you
may speak; they must hear, etc. The infinitive usually omits to with
the verbs let, dare, do, bid, make, see, hear, need, etc.; as, let me
go; you dare not tell; make him work; hear him talk, etc.

Note: In Anglo-Saxon, the simple infinitive was not preceded by to
but it had a dative form
which was preceded by to,
and was chiefly employed in expressing purpose. See Gerund, 2. Note: The gerundial ending not only took the same form as the
simple infinitive, but it was confounded with the present
participle in -ende, or -inde.

INTERNAL-COMBUSTION; INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINE

produce motion is developed in the engine cylinder, as by the
explosion of a gas, and not in a separate chamber, as in a steam-
engine boiler. The gas used may be a fixed gas, or one derived from
alcohol, ether, gasoline, naphtha, oil, etc.
There are three main classes: gas engines proper, using fixed
gases, as coal, blast-furnace, or producer gas; engines using the
vapor of a volatile fluid, as the typical gasoline engine;
oil engines, using either an atomized spray or the vapor
of a comparatively heavy oil, as petroleum or
kerosene. In all of these the gas is mixed with a definite amount of
air, the charge is composed in the cylinder and is then exploded
either by a flame of gas, by a
hot tube or the like, by an electric spark cycle, though many use the two-stroke cycle.
They are almost universally trunk engines and single-acting. Because
of the intense heat produced by the frequent explosions, the
cylinders must be cooled by a water jacket or by air
currents to give the maximum thermodynamic efficiency
and to avoid excessive friction or seizing.

IRON
I"ron, n.

1.
The most common and most useful metallic element, being of
almost universal occurrence, usually in the form of an oxide, or a hydrous oxide. It is reduced on an enormous scale in three principal forms;
viz., cast iron, steel, and wrought iron. Iron usually appears dark
brown, from oxidation or impurity, but when pure, or an fresh
surface, is a gray or white metal. It is easily oxidized by
moisture, and is attacked by many corrosive agents. Symbol Fe. Atomic weight 55.9. Specific gravity, pure iron, 7.86; cast
iron, 7.1. In magnetic properties, it is superior to all other
substances.

Note: The value of iron is largely due to the facility with which it
can be worked. Thus, when heated it is malleable and ductile, and can
be easily welded and forged at a high temperature. As cast iron, it
is easily fusible; as steel, is very tough, and very
hard and elastic. Chemically, iron is grouped with cobalt and nickel.
Steel is a variety of iron containing more carbon than wrought iron,
but less that cast iron. It is made either from wrought iron, by
roasting in a packing of carbon or from cast iron, by
burning off the impurities in a Bessemer converter, or directly from the iron ore.

2. An instrument or utensil made of iron; -- chiefly in composition;
as, a flatiron, a smoothing iron, etc.

3. pl.
Fetters; chains; handcuffs; manacles.

4. Strength; power; firmness; inflexibility; as, to rule with a rod
of iron. Bar iron. See Wrought iron.
-- Bog iron, bog ore; limonite. See Bog ore, under Bog.
-- Cast iron, an impure variety of iron, containing from
three to six percent of carbon, part of which is united with a part
of the iron, as a carbide, and the rest is uncombined, as graphite.
It there is little free carbon, the product is white iron; if much of
the carbon has separated as graphite, it is called gray iron. See
also Cast iron, in the Vocabulary.
-- Fire irons. See under Fire, n.
-- Gray irons. See under Fire, n.
-- Gray iron. See Cast iron.
-- It irons, said of a sailing vessel, when, in tacking, she

capable of extension under the hammer; also, specif., a kind of iron
produced by removing a portion of the carbon or other impurities from
cast iron, rendering it less brittle, and to some extent malleable.
-- Meteoric iron, iron forming a large, and often the chief,
ingredient of meteorites. It invariably contains a small amount of

-- White iron. See Cast iron.
-- Wrought iron, the purest form of iron commonly known in
the arts, containing only about half of one per cent of carbon. It is
made either directly from the ore, as in the Catalan forge or
bloomery, or by purifying cast iron in a reverberatory
furnace or refinery. It is tough, malleable, and ductile. When formed
into bars, it is called bar iron.
