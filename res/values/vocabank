apa. Cf.Off, A- (2), Ab-, After, Epi-.]

Defn: In a general sense, from, or out from; proceeding from;
belonging to; relating to; concerning; -- used in a variety of
applications; as:

1. Denoting that from which anything proceeds; indicating origin,
source, descent, and the like; as, he is of a race of kings; he is of
noble blood.
That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son
of God. Luke i. 35.
I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you. 1
Cor. xi. 23.

2. Denoting possession or ownership, or the relation of subject to
attribute; as, the apartment of the consul: the power of the king; a
man of courage; the gate of heaven. "Poor of spirit." Macaulay.

3. Denoting the material of which anything is composed, or that which
it contains; as, a throne of gold; a sword of steel; a wreath of
mist; a cup of water.

4. Denoting part of an aggregate or whole; belonging to a number or

Note: From is the primary sense of this preposition; a sense retained
in off, the same word differently written for distinction. But this
radical sense disappears in most of its application; as, a man of
genius; a man of rare endowments; a fossil of a red color, or of an
hexagonal figure; he lost all hope of relief; an affair of the
cabinet; he is a man of decayed fortune; what is the price of corn In
these and similar phrases, of denotes property or possession, or a
relation of some sort involving connection. These applications,
however all proceeded from the same primary sense. That which
proceeds from, or is produced by, a person or thing, either has had,
or still has, a close connection with the same; and hence the word
was applied to cases of mere connection, not involving at all the
idea of separation. Of consequence, of importance, value, or
influence.
 -- Of late, recently; in time not long past.
 -- Of old, formerly; in time long past.
 -- Of one's self, by one's self; without help or prompting;
spontaneously.
