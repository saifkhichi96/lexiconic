EASTERN CHURCH
Eastern Church.


That portion of the Christian church which prevails in the
countries once comprised in the Eastern Roman Empire and the
countries converted to Christianity by missionaries from them. Its
full official title is The Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Eastern
Church. It became estranged from the Western, or Roman, Church over
the question of papal supremacy and the doctrine of the filioque, and
a separation, begun in the latter part of the 9th century, became
final in 1054. The Eastern Church consists of twelve mutually independent churches
using the vernacular in divine service and varying in many points of detail, but
standing in full communion with each other and united as equals in a
great federation. The highest five authorities are the patriarch of
Constantinople, or ecumenical patriarch, the patriarch of Alexandria, the
patriarch of Jerusalem, the patriarch of Antioch, and the Holy Synod
of Russia. The Eastern Church accepts the first seven ecumenical
councils, has as its creed the Niceno-
Constantinopolitan, baptizes infants with trine immersion, makes confirmation
follow immediately upon baptism, administers the Communion in both
kinds and to infants as well as adults,
permits its secular clergy to marry before ordination and to keep
their wives afterward, but not to marry a second time, selects its
bishops from the monastic clergy only, recognizes the offices of
bishop, priest, and deacon as the three necessary degrees of orders,
venerates relics and icons, and has an elaborate ritual.

-- Economy, Frugality, Parsimony. Economy avoids all waste and
extravagance, and applies money to the best advantage; frugality cuts
off indulgences, and proceeds on a system of saving. The latter
conveys the idea of not using or spending superfluously, and is
opposed to lavishness or profusion. Frugality is usually applied to
matters of consumption, and commonly points to simplicity of manners;
parsimony is frugality carried to an extreme, involving meanness of
spirit, and a sordid mode of living. Economy is a virtue, and
parsimony a vice.

liberty and ease. Swift.

-- Effect, Consequence, Result. These words indicate things which

sequence, but following out of and following indirectly, or in the
train of events, something on which it truly depends. A result is
still more remote and variable, like the rebound of an elastic body
which falls in very different directions. We may foresee the effects
of a measure, may conjecture its consequences, but can rarely
discover its final results.

properties in opposite directions; also, by attraction for many
substances, by a law involving attraction between surfaces of unlike
polarity, and repulsion between those of like; by exhibiting
accumulated polar tension when the circuit is broken; and by
producing heat, light, concussion, and often chemical changes when
the circuit passes between the poles or through any imperfectly
conducting substance or space. It is generally brought into action by
any disturbance of molecular equilibrium, whether from a chemical,
physical, or mechanical, cause.

Note: Electricity is manifested under following different forms:
Statical electricity, called also Frictional or Common, electricity,
electricity in the condition of a stationary charge, in which the
disturbance is produced by friction, as of glass, amber, etc., or by
induction. Dynamical electricity, called also Voltaic
electricity, electricity in motion, or as a current produced by
chemical decomposition, as by means of a voltaic battery, or by
mechanical action, as by dynamo-electric machines.
Thermoelectricity, in which the disturbing cause is heat. It is developed by uniting two
pieces of unlike metals in a bar, and then heating the bar unequally.
Atmospheric electricity, any condition of electrical disturbance
in the atmosphere or clouds, due to some or all of the above
mentioned causes. Magnetic electricity, electricity developed by
the action of magnets. Positive electricity, the electricity that
appears at the positive pole or anode of a battery, or that is

The essential fact regarding every element is its relative atomic
weight or equivalent. When the elements are tabulated in the order of
their ascending atomic weights, the arrangement constitutes the
series of the Periodic law of Mendelejeff. See Periodic law, under
Periodic. This Periodic law enables us to predict the qualities of
unknown elements. The number of elements known is about seventy-five,
but the gaps in the Periodic law indicate the possibility of many
more. Many of the elements with which we are familiar, as hydrogen,
carbon, iron, gold, etc., have been recognized, by means of spectrum
analysis, in the sun and the fixed stars. From certain evidence it
appears that the chemical elements probably may not be simple bodies,
but only very stable compounds of some simpler body or bodies. In
formulas, the elements are designated by abbreviations of their names
in Latin or New Latin.

their existence, have not yet been definitely established.

3. One of the ultimate parts which are variously combined in
anything; as, letters are the elements of written language; hence,

of birds. Hence, the state or sphere natural to anything or suited
for its existence.

Note: The kinetic energy of a body is the energy it has in virtue of
being in motion. It is measured by one half of the product of the
mass of each element of the body multiplied by the square of the
velocity of the element, relative to some given body or point. The
available kinetic energy of a material system unconnected with any
other system is that energy which is due to the motions of the parts
of the system relative to its center of mass. The potential energy of
a body or system is that energy which is not kinetic; -- energy due
to configuration. Kinetic energy is sometimes called actual energy.
Kinetic energy is exemplified in the vis viva of moving bodies, in
heat, electric currents, etc.; potential energy, in a bent spring, or
a body suspended a given distance above the earth and acted on by
gravity.

add nothing to the sense of their noun, but simply hold forth some
quality necessarily implied therein; as, the bright sun, the lofty
heavens, etc. But this restriction does not prevail in general
literature. Epithet is sometimes confounded with application, which
is always a noun or its equivalent.

Equity had been gradually shaping itself into a refined science which
no human faculties could master without long and intense application.
Macaulay.

Note: Equitable jurisprudence in England and in the United States
grew up from the inadequacy of common-law forms to secure justice in
all cases; and this led to distinct courts by which equity was
applied in the way of injunctions, bills of discovery, bills for
specified performance, and other processes by which the merits of a
case could be reached more summarily or more effectively than by
common-law suits. By the recent English Judicature Act,
however, the English judges are bound to give effect, in common-law
suits, to all equitable rights and remedies; and when the rules of
equity and of common law, in any particular case, conflict, the rules
of equity are to prevail. In many jurisdictions in the United States,
equity and common law are thus blended; in others distinct equity
tribunals are still maintained. See Chancery. Equity of redemption
the advantage, allowed to a mortgageor, of a certain or
reasonable time to redeem lands mortgaged, after they have been
forfeited at law by the nonpayment of the sum of money due on the
mortgage at the appointed time. Blackstone.

He owned that, if the Test Act were repealed, the Protestants were
entitled to some equivalent.... During some weeks the word
equivalent, then lately imported from France, was in the mouths of
all the coffeehouse. Macaulay.

2. 
That comparative quantity by weight of an element which
possesses the same chemical value as other elements, as determined by
actual experiment and reference to the same standard. Specifically:
The comparative proportions by which one element replaces another
in any particular compound; thus, as zinc replaces hydrogen in
hydrochloric acid, their equivalents are 32.5 and 1. The
combining proportion by weight of a substance, or the number
expressing this proportion, in any particular compound; as, the
equivalents of hydrogen and oxygen in water are respectively 1 and 8,
and in hydric dioxide 1 and 16. Note: This term was adopted by Wollaston to avoid using the
conjectural expression atomic weight, with which, however, for a time
it was practically synonymous. The attempt to limit the term to the
meaning of a universally comparative combining weight failed, because
of the possibility of several compounds of the substances by reason
of the variation in combining power which most elements exhibit. The
equivalent was really identical with, or a multiple of submultiple
of, the atomic weight.

3. 
A combining unit, whether an atom, a radical, or a molecule;
as, in acid salt two or more equivalents of acid unite with one or
more equivalents of base. Mechanical equivalent of heat,
the number of units of work which the unit of heat can perform; the
mechanical energy which must be expended to raise the temperature of
a unit weight of water from 0º C. to 1º C., or from 32º F. to 33º F.
The term was introduced by Dr. Mayer of Heilbronn. Its value was
found by Joule to be 1390 foot pounds upon the Centigrade, or 772
foot pounds upon the Fahrenheit, thermometric scale, whence it is
often called Joule's equivalent, and represented by the symbol J.
This is equal to 424 kilogram meters. A more
recent determination by Professor Rowland gives the value 426.9
kilogram meters, for the latitude of Baltimore.

Syn.
-- Ambiguous; doubtful; uncertain; indeterminate.
-- Equivocal, Ambiguous. We call an expression ambiguous when it has
one general meaning, and yet contains certain words which may be
taken in two different senses; or certain clauses which can be so
connected with other clauses as to divide the mind between different
views of part of the meaning intended. We call an expression
equivocal when, taken as a whole, it conveys a given thought with

-- To Estimate, Esteem. Both these words imply an exercise of the
judgment. Estimate has reference especially to the external relations

involves computation or calculation; as, to estimate the loss or gain
of an enterprise. Esteem has reference to the intrinsic or moral

sentiment of respect and attachment. We esteem it an honor to live in

Syn.
-- Estimate, Estimation, Esteem. The noun estimate, like its verb,
supposes chiefly an exercise of judgment in determining the amount,
importance, or magnitude of things, with their other exterior
relations; as, an estimate of expenses incurred; a true estimate of
life, etc. Esteem is a moral sentiment made up of respect and
attachment, -- the valuation of a person as possessing useful
qualities or real worth. Thus we speak of the esteem of the wise and
good as a thing greatly to be desired. Estimation seems to waver
between the two. In our version of the Scriptures it is used simply
for estimate; as, "If he be poorer than thy estimation." Lev. xxvii.
8. In other cases, it verges toward esteem; as, "I know him to be of
worth and worthy estimation.". It will probably settle down at
last on this latter sense. "Esteem is the value we place upon some
degree of worth. It is higher than simple approbation, which is a
decision of judgment. It is the commencement of affection." Gogan.
No; dear as freedom is, and in my heart's Just estimation prized
above all price. Cowper.

EVENT
E*vent", n.

1. That which comes, arrives, or happens; that which falls out; any
incident, good or bad. "The events of his early years." Macaulay.
To watch quietly the course of events. Jowett
There is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked. Eccl. ix. 2. 2. An affair in hand; business; enterprise. "Leave we him to
his events.".

3. The consequence of anything; the issue; conclusion; result; that
in which an action, operation, or series of operations, terminates.
Dark doubts between the promise and event. Young.

Syn.
-- Incident; occurrence; adventure; issue; result; termination;
consequence; conclusion.
-- Event, Occurrence, Incident, Circumstance. An event denotes that
which arises from a preceding state of things. Hence we speak or
watching the event; of tracing the progress of events. An occurrence
has no reference to any antecedents, but simply marks that which
meets us in our progress through life, as if by chance, or in the
course of divine providence. The things which thus meet us, if
important, are usually connected with antecedents; and hence event is
the leading term. In the "Declaration of Independence" it is said,
"When, in the cource of human events, it becomes necessary." etc.
Here, occurrences would be out of place. An incident is that which
falls into a state of things to which is does not primarily belong;
as, the incidents of a journey. The term is usually applied to things
of secondary importance. A circumstance is one of the things
surrounding us in our path of life. These may differ greatly in
importance; but they are always outsiders, which operate upon us from
without, exerting greater or less influence according to their
intrinsic importance. A person giving an account of a campaign might
dwell on the leading events which it produced; might mention some of
its striking occurrences; might allude to some remarkable incidents
which attended it; and might give the details of the favorable or
adverse circumstances which marked its progress.

it signifies out of, as, in exhale, exclude; off, from, or out. as in
exscind; beyond, as, in excess, exceed, excel; and sometimes has a
privative sense of without, as in exalbuminuos, exsanguinous. In some
words, it intensifies the meaning; in others, it has little affect on
the signification. It becomes ef- before f, as in effuse. The form e-
occurs instead of ex- before b, d, g, l, m, n, r, and v, as in
ebullient, emanate, enormous, etc. In words from the French it often
appears as es-, sometimes as s- or é-; as, escape, scape, élite. Ex-,
prefixed to names implying office, station, condition, denotes that
the person formerly held the office, or is out of the office or
condition now; as, ex-president, ex-governor, ex-mayor, ex-convict.
The Greek form 'ex becomes ex in English, as in exarch; 'ek becomes
ec, as in eccentric.

Now these things were our examples, to the intent that we should not

especially a problem to be solved, or a case to be determined, as an
exercise in the application of the rules of any study or branch of
science; as, in trigonometry and grammar, the principles and rules
are illustrated by examples.

Syn.
-- Precedent; case; instance.
-- Example, Instance. The discrimination to be made between these
two words relates to cases in which we give "instances" or "examples"
of things done. An instance denotes the single case then "standing"
before us; if there be others like it, the word does not express this
fact. On the contrary, an example is one of an entire class of like
things, and should be a true representative or sample of that class.
Hence, an example proves a rule or regular course of things; an
instance simply points out what may be true only in the case
presented. A man's life may be filled up with examples of the self-
command and kindness which marked his character, and may present only
a solitary instance of haste or severity. Hence, the word "example"
should never be used to describe what stands singly and alone. We do,
however, sometimes apply the word instance to what is really an
example, because we are not thinking of the latter under this aspect,
but solely as a case which "stands before us." See Precedent.

-- Except, Excepting, But, Save, Besides. Excepting, except, but,
and save are exclusive. Except marks exclusion more pointedly. "I
have finished all the letters except one," is more marked than "I
have finished all the letters but one." Excepting is the same as
except, but less used. Save is chiefly found in poetry. Besides
is in the nature of addition. "There is no one
here except or but him," means, take him away and there is nobody
present. "There is nobody here besides him," means, hi is present and
by the side of, or in addition to, him is nobody. "Few ladies, except
her Majesty, could have made themselves heard." In this example,
besides should be used, not except.

EYE
Eye, n.

1. The organ of sight or vision. In man, and the vertebrates
generally, it is properly the movable ball or globe in the orbit, but
the term often includes the adjacent parts. In most invertebrates the
years are immovable ocelli, or compound eyes made up of numerous
ocelli. See Ocellus. Description of illustration: a b Conjunctiva; c
Cornea; d Sclerotic; e Choroid; f Cillary Muscle; g Cillary Process;
h Iris; i Suspensory Ligament; k Prosterior Aqueous Chamber between h
and i; l Anterior Aqueous Chamber; m Crystalline Lens; n Vitreous
Humor; o Retina; p Yellow spot; q Center of blind spot; r Artery of
Retina in center of the Optic Nerve.

Note: The essential parts of the eye are inclosed in a tough outer
coat, the sclerotic, to which the muscles moving it are attached, and
which in front changes into the transparent cornea. A little way back
of cornea, the crystalline lens is suspended, dividing the eye into
two unequal cavities, a smaller one in front filled with a watery
fluid, the aqueous humor, and larger one behind filled with a clear
jelly, the vitreous humor. The sclerotic is lined with a highly
pigmented membrane, the choroid, and this is turn is lined in the
back half of the eyeball with the nearly transparent retina, in which
the fibers of the optic nerve ramify. The choroid in front is
continuous with the iris, which has a contractile opening in the
center, the pupil, admitting light to the lens which brings the rays
to a focus and forms an image upon the retina, where the light,
falling upon delicate structures called rods and cones, causes them
to stimulate the fibres of the optic nerve to transmit visual
impressions to the brain.

2. The faculty of seeing; power or range of vision; hence, judgment
or taste in the use of the eye, and in judging of objects; as, to
have the eye of sailor; an eye for the beautiful or picturesque.

3. The action of the organ of sight; sight, look; view; ocular
knowledge; judgment; opinion.
In my eye, she is the sweetest lady that I looked on..

4. The space commanded by the organ of sight; scope of vision; hence,
face; front; the presence of an object which is directly opposed or
confronted; immediate presence.
We shell express our duty in his eye..
Her shell your hear disproved to her eyes..

5. Observation; oversight; watch; inspection; notice; attention;
regard. "Keep eyes upon her.".
Booksellers... have an eye to their own advantage. Addison.

6. That which resembles the organ of sight, in form, position, or
appearance; as:
The spots on a feather, as of peacock.
The scar to which the adductor muscle is attached in oysters and
other bivalve shells; also, the adductor muscle itself, esp. when
