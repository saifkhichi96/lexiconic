C

1. C is the third letter of the English alphabet. It is from the Latin letter C, which in old Latin represented the sounds of k, and g; its original value being the latter. In Anglo-Saxon words, or Old English before the Norman Conquest, it always has the sound of k. The Latin C was the same letter as the Greek got it from the Phoenicians. The English name of C is from the Latin name ce, and was derived, probably, through the French. Etymologically C is related to g, h, k, q, s. Examples of these relations are in L. acutus, E. acute, ague; E. acrid, eagar; L. cornu, E. horn; E. cat, kitten; E. coy, quiet; L. circare, OF. cerchier, E. search.

2. The keynote of the normal or "natural" scale, which has
neither flats nor sharps in its signature; also, the third note of
the relative minor scale of the same C after the clef is the mark
of common time, in which each measure is a semibreve; for alla breve time it is written The "C clef," a
modification of the letter C, placed on any line of the staff, abows
that line to be middle C.

3. As a numeral, C stands for Latin centum or 100, CC for 200, etc. C
spring, a spring in the form of the letter C.

-- Can but, Can not but. It is an error to use the former of these
phrases where the sens requires the latter. If we say, "I can but
perish if I go," "But" means only, and denotes that this is all or
the worst that can happen. When the apostle Peter said. "We can not
but speak of the things which we have seen and heard." he referred to
a moral constraint or necessety which rested upon him and his
associates; and the meaning was, We cannot help speaking, We cannot
refrain from speaking. This idea of a moral necessity or constraint
is of frequent occurrence, and is also expressed in the phrase, "I
can not help it." Thus we say. "I can not but hope," "I can not but
believe," "I can not but think," "I can not but remark," etc., in
cases in which it would be an error to use the phrase can but.
Yet he could not but acknowledge to himself that there was something
calculated to impress awe,... in the sudden appearances and

oxide. Carbonic acid, an acid H2CO3, not existing separately,
which, combined with positive or basic atoms or radicals, forms
carbonates. On common language the term is very generally applied to
a compound of carbon and oxygen, CO2, more correctly called carbon
dioxide. It is a colorless, heavy, irrespirable gas, extinguishing
flame, and when breathed destroys life. It can be reduced to a liquid
and solid form by intense pressure. It is produced in the
fermentation of liquors, and by the combustion and decomposition of
organic substances, or other substances containing carbon. It is
formed in the explosion of fire damp in mines, and is hance called
after damp; it is also know as choke damp, and mephilic air. Water
will absorb its own volume of it, and more than this under pressure,
and in this state becomes the common soda water of the shops, and the
carbonated water of natural springs. Combined with lime it
constitutes limestone, or common marble and chalk. Plants imbibe it
for their nutrition and growth, the carbon being retained and the
oxygen given out.
-- Carbonic oxide, a colorless gas, CO, of a light odor,
called more correctly carbon monoxide. It is almost the only
definitely known compound in which carbon seems to be divalent. It is
a product of the incomplete combustion of carbon, and is an abundant
constituent of water gas. It is fatal to animal life, extinguishes
combustion, and burns with a pale blue flame, forming carbon dioxide.

Having the radicle turned toward the sides of the fruit, as some
embryos. Centrifugal force, a force whose direction is from a
center.

Note: When a body moves in a circle with uniform velocity, a force
must act on the body to keep it in the circle without change of
velocity. The direction of this force is towards the center of the
circle. If this force is applied by means of a string to the body,
the string will be in a state of tension. To a person holding the
other end of the string, this tension will appear to be directed
toward the body as if the body had a tendency to move away from the
center of the circle which it is describing. Hence this latter force
is often called centrifugal force. The force which really acts on the
body being directed towards the center of the circle is called
centripetal force, and in some popular treatises the centripetal and
centrifugal forces are described as opposing and balancing each
other. But they are merely the different aspects of the same stress.

1. A supposed material or psychical agent or mode of activity other

It is strictly and philosophically true in nature and reason that
there is no such thing as chance or accident; it being evident that
these words do not signify anything really existing, anything that is
truly an agent or the cause of any event; but they signify merely
men's ignorance of the real and immediate cause. Samuel Clark.

Note: The chancellor was originally a chief scribe or secretary under
the Roman emperors, but afterward was invested with judicial powers,
and had superintendence over the other officers of the empire. From
the Roman empire this office passed to the church, and every bishop
has his chancellor, the principal judge of his consistory. In later
times, in most countries of Europe, the chancellor was a high officer
of state, keeper of the great seal of the kingdom, and having the
supervision of all charters, and like public instruments of the
crown, which were authenticated in the most solemn manner. In France
a secretary is in some cases called a chancellor. In Scotland, the
appellation is given to the foreman of a jury, or assize. In the
present German empire, the chancellor is the president of the federal
council and the head of the imperial administration. In the United
States, the title is given to certain judges of courts of chancery or
equity, established by the statutes of separate States. Blackstone.

CHANCERY
Chan"cer*y, n.

division of the High Court of Justice, and now exercises jurisdiction
only in equity.

2. In the Unites States, a court of equity; equity; proceeding in
equity.

Note: A court of chancery, so far as it is a court of equity, in the
English and American sense, may be generally, if not precisely,
described as one having jurisdiction in cases of rights, recognized
and protected by the municipal jurisprudence, where a plain,
adequate, and complete remedy can not be had in the courts of common
law. In some of the American States, jurisdiction at law and in
equity centers in the same tribunal. The courts of the United States
also have jurisdiction both at law and in equity, and in all such
cases they exercise their jurisdiction, as courts of law, or as
courts of equity, as the subject of adjudication may require. In
others of the American States, the courts that administer equity are
distinct tribunals, having their appropriate judicial officers, and
it is to the latter that the appellation courts of chancery is
usually applied; but, in American law, the terms equity and court of
equity are more frequently employed than the corresponding terms
chancery and court of chancery. Burrill. Inns of chancery. See under
Inn.
-- To get In chancery, to get the head of an
antagonist under one's arm, so that one can pommel it with the other

Cloud, n.

I do set my bow in the cloud. Gen. ix. 13. Note: A classification of clouds according to their chief forms was
first proposed by the meteorologist Howard, and this is still
substantially employed. The following varieties and subvarieties are
recognized: Cirrus. This is the most elevated of all the forms of
clouds; is thin, long-drawn, sometimes looking like carded wool or
hair, sometimes like a brush or room, sometimes in curl-like or
fleecelike patches. It is the cat's-tail of the sailor, and the
mare's-tail of the landsman. Cumulus. This form appears in large
masses of a hemispherical form, or nearly so, above, but flat below,
one often piled above another, forming great clouds, common in the
summer, and presenting the appearance of gigantic mountains crowned
with snow. It often affords rain and thunder gusts. Stratus. This
form appears in layers or bands extending horizontally. Nimbus.
This form is characterized by its uniform gray tint and ragged edges;
it covers the sky in seasons of continued rain, as in easterly
storms, and is the proper rain cloud. The name is sometimes used to
denote a raining cumulus, or cumulostratus. Cirro-cumulus. This
form consists, like the cirrus, of thin, broken, fleecelice clouds,
but the parts are more or less rounded and regulary grouped. It is
popularly called mackerel sky. Cirro-stratus. In this form the
patches of cirrus coalesce in long strata, between cirrus and
stratus. Cumulo-stratus. A form between cumulus and stratus,
often assuming at the horizon a black or bluish tint.
-- Fog, cloud, motionless, or nearly so, lying near or in contact
with the earth's surface.
-- Storm scud, cloud lying quite low, without form, and driven
rapidly with the wind.

2. A mass or volume of smoke, or flying dust, resembling vapor. "A
thick cloud of incense." Ezek. viii. 11. 3. A dark vein or spot on a lighter material, as in marble; hence, a
blemish or defect; as, a cloud upon one's reputation; a cloud on a
title.

4. That which has a dark, lowering, or threatening aspect; that which
temporarily overshadows, obscures, or depresses; as, a cloud of
sorrow; a cloud of war; a cloud upon the intellect.

of witnesses." Heb. xii. 1. 6. A large, loosely-knitted scarf, worn by women about the head.

2. To compel or constrain to any action; as, to coerce a man to vote
for a certain candidate.

3. To compel or enforce; as, to coerce obedience.

Syn.
-- To Coerce, Compel. To compel denotes to urge on by force which
cannot be resisted. The term aplies equally to physical and moral
force; as, compelled by hunger; compelled adverse circumstances;
compelled by parental affection. Coerce had at first only the
negative sense of checking or restraining by force; as, to coerce a
bad man by punishments or a prisoner with fetters. It has now gained
a positive sense., viz., that of driving a person into the
performance of some act which is required of him by another; as, to
coerce a man to sign a contract; to coerce obedience. In this sense
coerce differs but little from
compel, and yet there is a distinction between them. Coercion is
usually acomplished by indirect means, as threats and intimidation,
physical force being more rarely employed in coercing.

2. The application to another of either physical or moral force.
When the force is physical, and cannot be resisted, then the act
produced by it is a nullity, so far as concerns the party coerced.
When the force is moral, then the act, though voidable, is imputable
to the party doing it, unless he be so paralyzed by terror as to act
convulsively. At the same time coercion is not negatived by the fact
of submission under force. "Coactus volui" is the condition of mind which, when there is volition
forced by coercion, annuls the result of such coercion. Wharton.

some instances, owing to the persistence of the luminous impression
upon the retina, and a gradual change of its character, as where a

wheel appear to the eye of different shades of color varying with the

auxiliary, indicative of approach to the action or state expressed by

Cor. i. 4..

Wordsworth.

Syn.
-- To cheer; solace; console; revive; encourage; enliven;
invigorate; inspirit, gladden; recreate; exhilarate; refresh;
animate; confirm; strengthen.
-- To Comfort, Console, Solace. These verbs all suppose some
antecedent state of suffering or sorrow. Console in confined to the
act giving sympathetic relief to the mind under affliction or sorrow,
and points to some definite source of that relief; as, the presence
of his friend consoled him; he was much consoled by this
intelligence. The act of consoling commonly implies the inculcation
of resignation. Comfort points to relief afforded by the
communication of positive pleasure, hope, and strength, as well as by
the diminution of pain; as, "They brought the young man alive, and
were not a little comforted." Acts xx. 12. Note: Solace is from L. solacium, which means according to Dumesnil,
consolation inwardly felt or applied to the case of the sufferer.
Hence, the verb to solace denotes the using of things for the purpose
of affording relief under sorrow or suffering; as, to solace one's
self with reflections, with books, or with active employments.

Syn.
-- To subdue; vanquish; overcome; overpower; overthrow; defeat;
rout; discomfit; subjugate; reduce; humble; crush; surmount; subject;
master.
-- To Conquer, Vanquish, Subdue, Subjugate, Overcome. These words
agree in the general idea expressed by overcome, -- that of bringing
under one's power by the exertion of force. Conquer is wider and more
general than vanquish, denoting usually a succession of conflicts.
Vanquish is more individual, and refers usually to a single conflict.
Thus, Alexander conquered Asia in a succession of battles, and
vanquished Darius in one decisive engagement. Subdue implies a more
gradual and continual pressure, but a surer and more final
subjection. We speak of a nation as subdued when its spirit is at
last broken, so that no further resistance is offered. Subjugate is
to bring completely under the yoke of bondage. The ancient Gauls were
never finally subdued by the Romans until they were completely
subjugated. These words, when used figuratively, have correspondent
meanings. We conquer our prejudices or aversions by a succesion of
conflicts; but we sometimes vanquish our reluctance to duty by one
decided effort: we endeavor to subdue our evil propensities by
watchful and persevering exertions. Subjugate is more commonly taken
in its primary meaning, and when used figuratively has generally a
bad sense; as, his reason was completely subjugated to the sway of
his passions.

is the foundation of the sound, and the state of the glottis is
something secondary." H. Sweet.

Syn.
-- Contagious, Infectious. These words have been used in very
diverse senses; but, in general, a contagious disease has considered
as one which is caught from another by contact, by the breath, by
bodily effluvia, etc.; while an infectious disease supposes some
entirely different cause acting by a hidden influence, like the
miasma of prison ships, of marshes, etc., infecting the system with
disease. "This distinction, though not universally admitted by
medical men, as to the literal meaning, of the words, certainly
applies to them in their figurative use. Thus we speak of the
contagious influence of evil associates; their contagion of bad
example, the contagion of fear, etc., when we refer to transmission
by proximity or contact. On the other hand, we speak of infection by
bad principles, etc., when we consider anything as diffused by some
hidden influence.

transmission or inoculation of the germs being required.

sound, are sometimes erroneously interchanged, as when a person
speaks of having "a very contemptible opinion of another."
Contemptible is applied to that which is the object of contempt; as,
contemptible conduct; acontemptible fellow. Contemptuous is applied
to that which indicates contempts; as, a contemptuous look; a
contemptuous remark; contemptuous treatment. A person, or whatever is

either contemptuous or contemptible; a thing may be contemptible, but
can not be contemptuous.

Syn.
-- Struggle; strife; contest; quarrel; combat; conflict; feud;
litigation; controversy; dissension; variance; disagreement; debate;
competition; emulation.
-- Contention, Strife. A struggle between two parties is the idea
common to these two words. Strife is a struggle for mastery;
contention is a struggle for the possession of some desired object,
or the accomplishment of some favorite end. Neither of the words is
necessairly used in a bad sense, since there may be a generous strife
or contention between two friends as to which shall incur danger or
submit to sacrifices. Ordinarily, however, these words denote a
struggle arising from bad passions. In that case, strife usually
springs from a quarrelsome temper, and contention from, a selfish
spirit which seeks its own aggrandizement, or is fearful lest others
should obtain too such. Strife has more reference to the manner than
to the object of a struggle, while contention takes more account of
the end to be gained.

Syn.
-- Conflict; combat; battle; encounter; shock; struggle; dispute;
altercation; debate; controvesy; difference; disagreement; strife.
-- Contest, Conflict, Combat, Encounter. Contest is the broadest
term, and had originally no reference to actual fighting. It was, on
the contrary, a legal term signifying to call witnesses, and hence
came to denote first a struggle in argument, and then a struggle for
some common object between opposing parties, usually one of
considerable duration, and implying successive stages or acts.
Conflict denotes literally a close personal engagement, in which
sense it is applied to actual fighting. It is, however, more commonly
used in a figurative sense to denote strenuous or direct opposition;
as, a mental conflict; conflicting interests or passions; a conflict
of laws. An encounter is a direct meeting face to face. Usually it is

whole current of one's feelings and the tenor of his actions. As such
a change carries with it the appearance of sincerity, the term

Pervert is a term of recent origin, designed to express the contrary
of convert, and to stigmatize a person as drawn off perverted from

Courage is that firmness of spirit and swell of soul which meets
danger without fear. Bravery is daring and impetuous courage, like
that of one who has the reward continually in view, and displays his
courage in daring acts. Fortitude has often been styled "passive
courage," and consist in the habit of encountering danger and
enduring pain with a steadfast and unbroken spirit. Valor is courage
exhibited in war, and can not be applied to single combats; it is
never used figuratively. Intrepidity is firm, unshaken courage.
Gallantry is adventurous courage, which courts danger with a high and
cheerful spirit. A man may show courage, fortitude, or intrepidity in
the common pursuits of life, as well as in war. Valor, bravery, and
gallantry are displayed in the contest of arms. Valor belongs only to
battle; bravery may be shown in single combat; gallantry may be
manifested either in attack or defense; but in the latter ease, the
defense is usually turned into an attack.

of Mexico.

Note: "The term creole negro is employed in the English West Indies
to distinguish the negroes born there from the Africans imported
during the time of the slave trade. The application of this term to
the colored people has led to an idea common in some parts of the
United States, though wholly unfounded, that it implies an admixture
greater or less of African blood." R. Hildreth.

Note: "The title did not first belong to the descendants of
Spanish, but of French, settlers, But such a meaning implied a
certain excellence of origin, and so came early to include any native
of French or Spanish descent by either parent, whose nonalliance with
the slave race entitled him to social rank. Later, the term was
adopted by, not conceded to, the natives of mixed blood, and is still
so used among themselves.... Besides French and Spanish, there are
even, for convenience of speech, 'colored' Creoles; but there are no
Italian, or Sicilian, nor any English, Scotch, Irish, or 'Yankee'
Creoles, unless of parentage married into, and themselves thoroughly
proselyted in, Creole society." G. W. Cable.

lateral axes are called, respectively, macrodiagonal and
brachydiagonal.
-- The preceding are erect forms, the axes intersecting at right
angles. The following are oblique. 4. The Monoclinic system, having
one of the intersections oblique, as in the oblique rhombic prism. In
this system, the lateral axes are called respectively, clinodiagonal

intersections oblique, as in the oblique rhomboidal prism. There is
also: 6. The Hexagonal system, in which there are three equal lateral axes, and a
vertical axis of variable length, as in the hexagonal prism and the
rhombohedron.

Note: The Diclinic system, sometimes recognized, with two oblique
intersections, is only a variety of the Triclinic.
