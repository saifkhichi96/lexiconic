U

U, the twenty-first letter of the English alphabet, is a
cursive form of the letter V, with which it was formerly used
interchangeably, both letters being then used both as vowels and
consonants. U and V are now, however, differentiated, U being used
only as a vowel or semivowel, and V only as a consonant. The true
primary vowel sound of U, in Anglo-Saxon, was the sound which it
still retains in most of the languages of Europe, that of long oo, as
in tool, and short oo, as in wood, answering to the French ou in
tour. Etymologically U is most closely related to o, y (vowel), w,
and v; as in two, duet, dyad, twice; top, tuft; sop, sup; auspice,
aviary. See V, also O and Y. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 130-144.

See Anti-.]

An inseparable verbal prefix or particle. It is prefixed: (a)
To verbs to express the contrary, and not the simple negative, of the
action of the verb to which it is prefixed; as in uncoil, undo,
unfold. (b) To nouns to form verbs expressing privation of the thing,
quality, or state expressed by the noun, or separation from it; as in
unchild, unsex. Sometimes particles and participial adjectives formed
with this prefix coincide in form with compounds of the negative
prefix un- (see 2d Un-); as in undone (from undo), meaning
unfastened, ruined; and undone (from 2d un- and done) meaning not
done, not finished. Un- is sometimes used with an intensive force
merely; as in unloose.

[Note] Compounds of this prefix are given in full in their proper
order in the Vocabulary.
$
UN-
Un-. Etym: [OE. & AS. un-; akin to OFries. un-, D. on-, OS., OHG., &
G. un-, Icel. o-, u-, Sw. o-, Dan. u-, W. an-, L. in-, Gr. an-, a-.
*193. Cf. A- not In- not, No, adv.]

An inseparable prefix, or particle, signifying not; in-; non-.
In- is prefixed mostly to words of Latin origin, or else to words
formed by Latin suffixes; un- is of much wider application, and is
attached at will to almost any adjective, or participle used
adjectively, or adverb, from which it may be desired to form a
corresponding negative adjective or adverb, and is also, but less
freely, prefixed to nouns. Un- sometimes has merely an intensive
force; as in unmerciless, unremorseless. I.

Un- is prefixed to adjectives, or to words used adjectively.
Specifically: --
(a) To adjectives, to denote the absence of the quality designated by
the adjective; as, ------ and the like.

(b) To past particles, or to adjectives formed after the analogy of
past particles, to indicate the absence of the condition or state
expressed by them; as, -Unabolishable Unabsolvable Unabsurd
Unabundant Unaccordant Unadoptable Unadventurous Unaffable
Unaffectionate Unafraid Unalliable Unallowablew Unalterable
Unambiguous Unambitious Unamendable Un-American Unamusive Unangular

Unchallengeable Unchangeable Unchary Unchastisable Uncheerful

---- and the like.

(c) To present particles which come from intransitive verbs, or are
themselves employed as adjectives, to mark the absence of the
activity, disposition, or condition implied by the participle; as, --
--- and the like.

[Note] The above classes of words are unlimited in extent, and such
compounds may be formed by any writer or speaker at will from almost
all the adjectives or participles in the language, excepting those
which have a recognized and usual negative correspondent with the
prefix -in. No attempt will be made, therefore, to define them all in
this Dictionary; many will be omitted from its Vocabulary which are
negations of the simple word, and are readily explained by prefixing
a not to the latter. Derivatives of these words in -ly and -ness will
also, for the most part, be omitted for the same or similar reasons.
There will be inserted as separate articles with definitions, the
following: --1. Those which have acquired an opposed or contrary,
instead of a merely negative, meaning; as, unfriendly, ungraceful,
unpalatable, unquiet, and the like; or else an intensive sense more
than a prefixed not would express; as, unending, unparalleled,
undisciplined, undoubted, unsafe, and the like. 2. Those which have
the value of independent words, inasmuch as the simple words are
either not used at all, or are rarely, or at least much less
frequently, used; as, unavoidable, unconscionable, undeniable,
unspeakable, unprecedented, unruly, and the like; or inasmuch as they
are used in a different sense from the usual meaning of the
primitive, or especially in one of the significations of the latter;
as, unaccountable, unalloyed, unbelieving, unpretending, unreserved,
and the like; or inasmuch as they are so frequently and familiarly
used that they are hardly felt to be of negative origin; as,
uncertain, uneven, and the like. 3. Those which are anomalous,
provincial, or, for some other reason, not desirable to be used, and
are so indicated; as, unpure for impure, unsatisfaction for
dissatisfaction, unexpressible for inexpressible, and the like. II.

Un- is prefixed to nouns to express the absence of, or the
contrary of, that which the noun signifies; as, unbelief, unfaith,
unhealth, unrest, untruth, and the like.

[Note] Compounds of this last class are given in full in their proper
order in the Vocabulary.

employed by the Germans. Sir W. Hamilton.

Moving in the manner of undulations, or waves; resembling the
motion of waves, which successively rise or swell rise or swell and
fall; pertaining to a propagated alternating motion, similar to that
of waves. Undulatory theory, or Wave theory (of light) (Opt.), that
theory which regards its various phenomena as due to undulations in
an ethereal medium, propagated from the radiant with immense, but
measurable, velocities, and producing different impressions on the
retina according to their amplitude and frequency, the sensation of
brightness depending on the former, that of color on the latter. The
undulations are supposed to take place, not in the direction of
propagation, as in the air waves constituting sound, but
transversely, and the various phenomena of refraction, polarization,
interference, etc., are attributable to the different affections of
these undulations in different circumstances of propagation. It is
computed that the frequency of the undulations corresponding to the
several colors of the spectrum ranges from 458 millions of millions
per second for the extreme red ray, to 727 millions of millions for
the extreme violet, and their lengths for the same colors, from the
thirty-eight thousandth to the sixty thousandth part of an inch. The
theory of ethereal undulations is applicable not only to the
phenomena of light, but also to those of heat.

a unit of measure; a thermal unit (see under Thermal). Water is the
substance generally employed, the unit being one gram or one pound,
and the temperature interval one degree of the Centigrade or
Fahrenheit scale. When referred to the gram, it is called the gram
degree. The British unit of heat, or thermal unit, used by engineers

8.3389 pounds avoirdupois of water at 39.8º Fahr. (about 231 cubic
inches) for liquid measure, etc.; in Great Britain, the pound
sterling, the pound troy, the yard, or -- Unit of power. (Mach.) See
Horse power.
 -- Unit of resistance. (Elec.) See Resistance, n., 4, and Ohm.

connecting the forked ends of the two shafts (Fig. 1). Since this
joint can not act when the angle of the shafts is less than 140º, a
double joint of the same kind is sometimes used for giving rotary
motion at angles less than 140º (Fig. 2).

universities was suitable to the end of their institutions, either
theology or something that was merely preparatory to theology. A.

[Note] From the Roman words universitas, collegium, corpus, are
derived the terms university, college, and corporation, of modern
languages; and though these words have obtained modified
significations in modern times, so as to indifferently applicable to

signification of the terms, whatever may have been added to them.
There is now no university, college, or corporation, which is not a
juristical person in the sense above explained [see def. 2, above];
wherever these words are applied to any association of persons not
stamped with this mark, it is an abuse of terms. Eng. Cyc.

the amount of about 500 grains by a man of average weight. Chemically
it is carbamide, CO(NH2)2, and when heated with strong acids or
alkalies is decomposed into carbonic acid and ammonia. It unites with
acids to form salts, as nitrate of urea, and it can be made
synthetically from ammonium cyanate, with which it is isomeric. Urea
ferment, a soluble ferment formed by certain bacteria, which,
however, yield the ferment from the body of their cells only after

URIM
U"rim, n. Etym: [Heb. , pl. of , fire light.]

A part or decoration of the breastplate of the high priest
among the ancient Jews, by which Jehovah revealed his will on certain
occasions. Its nature has been the subject of conflicting
conjectures.
Thou shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the
Thummim. Ex. xxviii. 30.
And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not,
neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 1 Sam. xxviii. 6.

[Note] Professor Plumptre supposes the Urim to have been a clear and
colorless stone set in the breastplate of the high priest as a symbol
of light, answering to the mystic scarab in the pectoral plate of the
ancient Egyptian priests, and that the Thummim was an image
corresponding to that worn by the priestly judges of Egypt as a
symbol of truth and purity of motive. By gazing steadfastly on these,
he may have been thrown into a mysterious, half ecstatic state, akin
to hypnotism, in which he lost all personal consciousness, and
received a spiritual illumination and insight.

color and peculiar odor, with an average density of 1.02. The average
amount excreted in 24 hours is from 40 to 60 ounces (about 1,200
cubic centimeters). Chemically, the urine is mainly an aqueous
solution of urea, salt (sodium chloride), and uric acid, together
with some hippuric acid and peculiar pigments. It usually has an acid
reaction, owing to the presence of acid phosphates of soda or free
uric acid. Normally, it contains about 960 parts of water to 40 parts
of solid matter, and the daily average excretion is 35 grams (540
grains) of urea, 0.75 gram (11 grains) of uric acid, and 16.5 grams
(260 grains) of salt. Abnormally, it may contain sugar as in

good usage and great liberty. Shak.

2. Manners; conduct; behavior.

4. Customary use or employment, as of a word or phrase in a
particular sense or signification.

5. Experience. 
In eld [old age] is both wisdom and usage. Chaucer.

Syn.
 -- Custom; use; habit.
 -- Usage, Custom. These words, as here compared, agree in expressing
the idea of habitual practice; but a custom is not necessarily a
usage. A custom may belong to many, or to a single individual. A
usage properly belongs to the great body of a people. Hence, we speak
of usage, not of custom, as the law of language. Again, a custom is
merely that which has been often repeated, so as to have become, in a
good degree, established. A usage must be both often repeated and of
long standing. Hence, we speak of a "hew custom," but not of a "new
usage." Thus, also, the "customs of society" is not so strong an
expression as the "usages of society." "Custom, a greater power than
nature, seldom fails to make them worship." Locke. "Of things once
received and confirmed by use, long usage is a law sufficient."
Hooker. In law, the words usage and custom are often used
interchangeably, but the word custom also has a technical and
restricted sense. See Custom, n., 3.

cold and hunger; soldiers used to hardships and danger.

of; as, to use up the supplies. (b) To exhaust; to tire out; to leave
no capacity of force or use in; to overthrow; as, he was used up by
fatigue. [Colloq.]

Syn.
 -- Employ.
 -- Use, Employ. We use a thing, or make use of it, when we derive
from it some enjoyment or service. We employ it when we turn that
service into a particular channel. We use words to express our
general meaning; we employ certain technical terms in reference to a
given subject. To make use of, implies passivity in the thing; as, to
make use of a pen; and hence there is often a material difference
between the two words when applied to persons. To speak of "making
use of another" generally implies a degrading idea, as if we had used
him as a tool; while employ has no such sense. A confidential friend
is employed to negotiate; an inferior agent is made use of on an
intrigue.
I would, my son, that thou wouldst use the power Which thy discretion
gives thee, to control And manage all. Cowper.
To study nature will thy time employ: Knowledge and innocence are
perfect joy. Dryden.

which forbid the hope of success, as fruitless when it fails, not
from any such difficulties, but from some unexpected hindrance
arising to frustrate it; as, the design was rendered fruitless by the
death of its projector. Ineffectual nearly resembles fruitless, but
implies a failure of a less hopeless character; as, after several
ineffectual efforts, I at last succeeded.
Useless are all words Till you have writ "performance" with your
swords. The other is for waiving. Beau. & Fl.

Interest in excess of a legal rate charged to a borrower for

[Note] The practice of requiring in repayment of money lent anything
more than the amount lent, was formerly thought to be a great moral
wrong, and the greater, the more was taken. Now it is not deemed more
wrong to take pay for the use of money than for the use of a house,
or a horse, or any other property. But the lingering influence of the
former opinion, together with the fact that the nature of money makes
it easier for the lender to oppress the borrower, has caused nearly
all Christian nations to fix by law the rate of compensation for the
use of money. Of late years, however, the opinion that money should
be borrowed and repaid, or bought and sold, upon whatever terms the
parties should agree to, like any other property, has gained ground
everywhere. Am. Cyc.
