original signification, and is applied to any substance in the
elastic or aëriform state.

generation, alternation of sexual with asexual generation, in
which the products of one process differ from those of the other, --
a form of reproduction common both to animal and vegetable organisms.
In the simplest form, the organism arising from sexual generation
produces offspiring unlike itself, agamogenetically. These, however,
in time acquire reproductive organs, and from their impregnated germs
the original parent form is reproduced. In more complicated cases,
the first series of organisms produced agamogenetically may give rise
to others by a like process, and these in turn to still other
generations. Ultimately, however, a generation is formed which
develops sexual organs, and the original form is reproduced.
-- Spontaneous generation, the fancied production of living
organisms without previously existing parents from inorganic matter,
or from decomposing organic matter, a notion which at one time had
many supporters; abiogenesis.

Ge`o*met"ric, Ge`o*met"ric*al, a.

Pertaining to, or according to the rules or principles of,
geometry; determined by geometry; as, a geometrical solution of a

Note: Geometric is often used, as opposed to algebraic, to include

geometrical which can be made by ruler and compasses, i. e., by means
of right lines and circles. Every construction or solution which
requires any other curve, or such motion of a line or circle as would
generate any other curve, is not geometrical, but mechanical. By
another distinction, a geometrical solution is one obtained by the
rules of geometry, or processes of analysis, and hence is exact;
while a mechanical solution is one obtained by trial, by actual
measurements, with instruments, etc., and is only approximate and
empirical. Geometrical curve. Same as Algebraic curve; -- so called

Ghost dance.

A religious dance of the North American Indians, participated

communion with the unseen world and the spirits of departed friends.
The dance is the chief rite of the Ghost-dance, or Messiah, religion,
which originated about 1890 in the doctrines of the Piute Wovoka, the
Indian Messiah, who taught that the time was drawing near when the
whole Indian race, the dead with the living, should be reunited to
live a life of millennial happiness upon a regenerated earth. The
religion inculcates peace, righteousness, and work, and holds that in
good time, without warlike intervention, the oppressive white rule
will be removed by the higher powers. The religion spread through a
majority of the western tribes of the United States, only in the case
of the Sioux, owing to local causes, leading to an outbreak.

GOLD
Gold, n.

1. A metallic element, constituting the most precious metal used
as a common commercial medium of exchange. It has a characteristic
yellow color, is one of the heaviest substances known, is soft, and very malleable and ductile. It is quite
unalterable by heat, moisture, and most corrosive agents, and
therefore well suited for its use in coin and jewelry. Symbol Au
Atomic weight 196.7. Note: Native gold contains usually eight to ten per cent of silver,
but often much more. As the amount of silver increases, the color
becomes whiter and the specific gravity lower. Gold is very widely
disseminated, as in the sands of many rivers, but in very small
quantity. It usually occurs in quartz veins, in slate
and metamorphic rocks, or in sand and alluvial soil, resulting from
the disintegration of such rocks. It also occurs associated with
other metallic substances, as in auriferous pyrites, and is combined
with tellurium in the minerals petzite, calaverite, sylvanite, etc.
Pure gold is too soft for ordinary use, and is hardened by alloying
with silver and copper, the latter giving a characteristic reddish
tinge. Gold also finds use in gold foil, in the pigment
purple of Cassius, and in the chloride, which is used as a toning
agent in photography.

2. Money; riches; wealth.
For me, the gold of France did not seduce..

3. A yellow color, like that of the metal; as, a flower tipped with
gold.

4. Figuratively, something precious or pure; as, hearts of gold.
