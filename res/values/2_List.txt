B
is the second letter of the English alphabet. It is etymologically related to p, v, f
w and m, letters representing sounds having a close organic
affinity to its own sound; as in Eng. bursar and purser; Eng. bear
and Lat. pear; Eng. silver and Ger. silber; Lat. cubitum and It.
gomito; Eng. seven, Anglo-Saxon seofon, Ger. sieben, Lat. septem,
Gr.ptan. The form of letter B is Roman, from Greek B, of
Semitic origin. The small b was formed by gradual change from the
capital B.

Note: In Music, B is the nominal of the seventh tone in the model
major scale, or of the second tone in it's
relative minor scale. B stands for B flat, the
tone a half step, or semitone, lower than B. In German, B stands for
our B, while our B natural is called H.

Note: In the trough battery, copper and zinc plates, connected in
pairs, divide the trough into cells, which are filled with an acid or
oxidizing liquid; the effect is exhibited when wires connected with
the two end-plates are brought together. In Daniell's battery, the
metals are zinc and copper, the former in dilute sulphuric acid, or a
solution of sulphate of zinc, the latter in a saturated solution of
sulphate of copper. A modification of this is the common gravity
battery, so called from the automatic action of the two fluids, which
are separated by their specific gravities. In Grove's battery,
platinum is the metal used with zinc; two fluids are used, one of
them in a porous cell surrounded by the other. In Bunsen's or the
carbon battery, the carbon of gas coke is substituted for the
platinum of Grove's. In Leclanché's battery, the elements are zinc in
a solution of ammonium chloride, and gas carbon surrounded with
manganese dioxide in a porous cell. A secondary battery is a battery
which usually has the two plates of the same kind, generally of lead,
in dilute sulphuric acid, and which, when traversed by an electric
current, becomes charged, and is then capable of giving a current of
itself for a time, owing to chemical changes produced by the charging
current. A storage battery is a kind of secondary battery used for
accumulating and storing the energy of electrical charges or
currents, usually by means of chemical work done by them; an
accumulator.

BAUME
Bau`mé", a.
Designating or conforming to either of the scales used by the
French chemist Antoine Baumé in the graduation of his hydrometers; of
or relating to Baumé's scales or hydrometers. There are two Baumé
hydrometers. One, which is used with liquids heavier than water,
sinks to 0º in pure water, and to 15º in a 15 per cent salt solution;
the other, for liquids lighter than water, sinks to 0º in a 10 per
cent salt solution and to 10º in pure water. In both cases the
graduation, based on the distance between these fundamental points,
is continued along the stem as far as desired. Since all the degrees
on a Baumé scale are thus equal in length, while those on a specific-
gravity scale grow smaller as the density increases, there is no
simple relation between degrees Bé. and Sp. gr. However, readings on
Baumés scale may be approximately reduced to specific gravities by
the following formulæ : for liquids heavier than water, sp. gr. = 144 ÷;
for liquids lighter than water, sp. gr. = 144 ÷.

BE
Be, v. i.

1. To exist actually, or in the world of fact; to have ex
To be contents his natural desire. Pope.
To be, or not to be: that is the question..

2. To exist in a certain manner or relation, -- whether as a reality
or as a product of thought; to exist as the subject of a certain
predicate, that is, as having a certain attribute, or as belonging to
a certain sort, or as identical with what is specified, -- a word or
words for the predicate being annexed; as, to be happy; to be here;
to be large, or strong; to be an animal; to be a hero; to be a
nonentity; three and two are five; annihilation is the cessation of
existence; that is the man.

3. To take place; to happen; as, the meeting was on Thursday.

4. To signify; to represent or symbolize; to answer to.
The field is the world. Matt. xiii. 38.
The seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. Rev.
i. 20.

Note: The verb to be is used in
forming the passive voice of other verbs; as, John has been struck by
James. It is also used with the past participle of many intransitive
verbs to express a state of the subject. But have is now more
commonly used as the auxiliary, though expressing a different sense;
as, "Ye have come too late -- but ye are come. " "The minstrel boy to
the war is gone." The present and imperfect tenses form, with the
infinitive, a particular future tense, which expresses necessity,
duty, or purpose; as, government is to be supported; we are to pay
our just debts; the deed is to be signed to-morrow.

Note: Have or had been, followed by to, implies movement. "I have
been to Paris." Sydney Smith. "Have you been to Franchard " R. L.
Stevenson.

Note: Been, or ben, was anciently the plural of the indicative
present. "Ye ben light of the world." Wyclif, Matt. v. 14. Afterwards
be was used, as in our Bible: "They that be with us are more than
they that be with them." 2 Kings vi. 16. Ben was also the old
infinitive: "To ben of such power." R. of Gloucester. Be is used as a
form of the present subjunctive: "But if it be a question of words
and names." Acts xviii. 15. But the indicative forms, is and are,
with if, are more commonly used. Be it so, a phrase of supposition,
equivalent to suppose it to be so; or of permission, signifying let
it be so..
-- If so be, in case.
-- To be from, to have come from; as, from what place are you I am
from Chicago.
-- To let be, to omit, or leave untouched; to let alone. "Let be,
therefore, my vengeance to dissuade." Spenser.

Syn.
-- To be, Exist. The verb to be, except in a few rare case, like
that of Shakespeare's "To be, or not to be", is used simply as a
copula, to connect a subject with its predicate; as, man is mortal;
the soul is immortal. The verb to exist is never properly used as a
mere copula, but points to things that stand forth, or have a
substantive being; as, when the soul is freed from all corporeal
alliance, then it truly exists. It is not, therefore, properly
synonymous with to be when used as a copula, though occasionally made
so by some writers for the sake of variety; as in the phrase "there
exists no reason for laying new taxes." We may, indeed, say, "a
friendship has long existed between them," instead of saying, "there
has long been a friendship between them;" but in this case, exist is
not a mere copula. It is used in its appropriate sense to mark the
friendship as having been long in existence.
$
BE
Be*.
A prefix, originally the same word as by; joined with verbs, it
serves: To intensify the meaning; as, bespatter, bestir. To
render an intransitive verb transitive; as, befall;
bespeak. To make the action of a verb particular
or definite; as, beget; beset.

Note: It is joined with certain substantives, and a few adjectives,
to form verbs; as, bedew, befriend, benight, besot; belate; belittle. It also occurs in certain nouns,
adverbs, and prepositions, often with something of the force of the
preposition by, or about; as, belief, behalf, bequest
; because, before, beneath, beside, between. In some words
the original force of be is obscured or lost; as, in become, begin,
behave, behoove, belong.

for he is a Christian." Since is less formal and more incidental than
because; as, I will do it since you request me. It more commonly

him to be out of town, I did not call. Inasmuch as seems to carry
with it a kind of qualification which does not belong to the rest.

Syn.
-- To Beg, Ask, Request. To ask is
the generic term which embraces all these words. To request is only a
polite mode of asking. To beg, in its original sense, was to ask with
earnestness, and implied submission, or at least deference. At
present, however, in polite life, beg has dropped its original
meaning, and has taken the place of both ask and request, on the
ground of its expressing more of deference and respect. Thus, we beg
a person's acceptance of a present; we beg him to favor us with his
company; a tradesman begs to announce the arrival of new goods, etc.
Crabb remarks that, according to present usage, "we can never talk of
asking a person's acceptance of a thing, or of asking him to do us a
favor." This can be more truly said of usage in England than in
America.

Syn.
-- Benevolence, Beneficence, Munificence. Benevolence marks a
disposition made up of a choice and desire for the happiness of
others. Beneficence marks the working of this disposition in
dispensing good on a somewhat broad scale. Munificence shows the same
disposition, but acting on a still broader scale, in conferring gifts
and favors. These are not necessarily confined to objects of
immediate utility. One may show his munificence in presents of
pictures or jewelry, but this would not be beneficence. Benevolence
of heart; beneficence of life; munificence in the encouragement of
letters.
$
BENEVOLENT
Be*nev"o*lent, a.
Having a disposition to do good; possessing or manifesting love
to mankind, and a desire to promote their prosperity and happiness;
disposed to give to good objects; kind; charitable.
-- Be*nev"o*lent*ly, adv.

Syn.
-- Benevolent, Beneficent. Etymologically considered, benevolent
implies wishing well to others, and beneficent, doing well. But by
degrees the word benevolent has been widened to include not only
feelings, but actions; thus, we speak of benevolent operations,
benevolent labors for the public good, benevolent societies. In like
manner, beneficent is now often applied to feelings; thus, we speak
of the beneficent intentions of a donor. This extension of the terms
enables us to mark nicer shades of meaning. Thus, the phrase
"benevolent labors" turns attention to the source of these labors,
viz., benevolent feeling; while beneficent would simply mark them as
productive of good. So, "beneficent intentions" point to the feelings
of the donor as bent upon some specific good act; while "benevolent
intentions" would only denote a general wish and design to do good.

Syn.
-- Predilection; turn. Bent, Bias, Inclination, Prepossession. These
words agree in describing a permanent influence upon the mind which
tends to decide its actions. Bent denotes a fixed tendency of the
mind in a given direction. It is the widest of these terms, and
applies to the will, the intellect, and the affections, taken
conjointly; as, the whole bent of his character was toward evil
practices. Bias is literally a weight fixed on one side of a ball
used in bowling, and causing it to swerve from a straight course.
Used figuratively, bias applies particularly to the judgment, and
denotes something which acts with a permanent force on the character
through that faculty; as, the bias of early education, early habits,
etc. Inclination is an excited state of desire or appetency; as, a
strong inclination to the study of the law. Prepossession is a
mingled state of feeling and opinion in respect to some person or
subject, which has laid hold of and occupied the mind previous to
inquiry. The word is commonly used in a good sense, an unfavorable
impression of this kind being denominated a prejudice. "Strong minds
will be strongly bent, and usually labor under a strong bias; but
there is no mind so weak and powerless as not to have its
inclinations, and none so guarded as to be without its
prepossessions." Crabb.

1. To ask or entreat with urgency; to supplicate; to implore.
I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts..
But Eve... besought his peace. Milton.

Syn.
-- To beg; to crave.
-- To Beseech, Entreat, Solicit, Implore, Supplicate. These words
agree in marking that sense of want which leads men to beg some
favor. To solicit is to make a request, with some degree of
earnestness and repetition, of one whom we address as a superior. To
entreat implies greater urgency, usually enforced by adducing reasons
or arguments. To beseech is still stronger, and belongs rather to the
language of poetry and imagination. To implore denotes increased
fervor of entreaty, as addressed either to equals or superiors. To
supplicate expresses the extreme of entreaty, and usually implies a
state of deep humiliation. Thus, a captive supplicates a conqueror to
spare his life. Men solicit by virtue of their interest with another;
they entreat in the use of reasoning and strong representations; they
beseech with importunate earnestness; they implore from a sense of
overwhelming distress; they supplicate with a feeling of the most
absolute inferiority and dependence.

To be beside one's self, to be out ob one's wits or senses.
Paul, thou art beside thyself. Acts xxvi. 24. Syn.
-- Beside, Besides. These words, whether used as prepositions or
adverbs, have been considered strictly synonymous, from an early
period of our literature, and have been freely interchanged by our
best writers. There is, however, a tendency, in present usage, to
make the following distinction between them: 1. That beside be used
only and always as a preposition, with the original meaning "by the
side of; " as, to sit beside a fountain; or with the closely allied
meaning "aside from", "apart from", or "out of"; as, this is beside
our present purpose; to be beside one's self with joy. The adverbial
sense to be wholly transferred to the cognate word. 2. That besides,
as a preposition, take the remaining sense "in addition to", as,
besides all this; besides the considerations here offered. "There was
a famine in the land besides the first famine." Gen. xxvi. 1. And
that it also take the adverbial sense of "moreover", "beyond", etc.,
which had been divided between the words; as, besides, there are
other considerations which belong to this case. The following
passages may serve to illustrate this use of the words: --
Lovely Thais sits beside thee. Dryden.
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside
themselves with fear..
It is beside my present business to enlarge on this speculation.
Locke.
Besides this, there are persons in certain situations who are

Syn.
-- Burden, Load. A burden is, in the literal sense, a weight to be
borne; a load is something laid upon us to be carried. Hence, when

them cheerfully or without complaint. They may arise from the nature
of our situation; they may be allotments of Providence; they may be
the consequences of our errors. What is upon us, as a load, we
commonly carry with greater reluctance or sense of oppression. Men
often find the charge of their own families to be a burden; but if to
this be added a load of care for others, the pressure is usually
serve and irksome.
