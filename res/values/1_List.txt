Syn.
-- Admission; access; entrance; initiation.
-- Admittance, Admission. These words are, to some extent, in a
state of transition and change. Admittance is now chiefly confined to
its primary sense of access into some locality or building. Thus we
see on the doors of factories, shops, etc. "No admittance." Its
secondary or moral sense, as "admittance to the church," is almost
entirely laid aside. Admission has taken to itself the secondary or
figurative senses; as, admission to the rights of citizenship;
admission to the church; the admissions made by one of the parties in
a dispute. And even when used in its primary sense, it is not
identical with admittance. Thus, we speak of admission into a
country, territory, and other larger localities, etc., where
admittance could not be used. So, when we speak of admission to a
concert or other public assembly, the meaning is not perhaps exactly
that of admittance, viz., access within the walls of the building,
but rather a reception into the audience, or access to the
performances. But the lines of distinction on this subject are one
definitely drawn.

To deck or dress with ornaments; to embellish; to set off to
advantage; to render pleasing or attractive.
As a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. Isa. lxi. 10. At church, with meek and unaffected grace, His looks adorned the
venerable place. Goldsmith.

Syn.
-- To deck; decorate; embellish; ornament; beautify; grace; dignify;
exalt; honor.
-- To Adorn, Ornament, Decorate, Embellish. We decorate and ornament
by putting on some adjunct which is attractive or beautiful, and
which serves to heighten the general effect. Thus, a lady's head-
dress may be ornament or decorated with flowers or jewelry; a hall
may be decorated or ornament with carving or gilding, with wreaths of
flowers, or with hangings. Ornament is used in a wider sense than
decorate. To embellish is to beautify or ornament richly, not so much
by mere additions or details as by modifying the thing itself as a
whole. It sometimes means gaudy and artificial decoration. We
embellish a book with rich engravings; a style is embellished with
rich and beautiful imagery; a shopkeeper embellishes his front window
to attract attention. Adorn is sometimes identical with decorate, as
when we say, a lady was adorned with jewels. In other cases, it seems
to imply something more. Thus, we speak of a gallery of paintings as
adorned with the works of some of the great masters, or adorned with
noble statuary and columns. Here decorated and ornamented would
hardly be appropriate. There is a value in these works of genius
beyond mere show and ornament. Adorn may be used of what is purely
moral; as, a character adorned with every Christian grace. Here
neither decorate, nor ornament, nor embellish is proper.

Some virtues are seen only in affliction. Addison.

Syn.
-- Calamity; sorrow; distress; grief; pain; adversity; misery;
wretchedness; misfortune; trouble; hardship.
-- Affliction, Sorrow, Grief, Distress. Affliction and sorrow are
terms of wide and general application; grief and distress have
reference to particular cases. Affliction is the stronger term. The
suffering lies deeper in the soul, and usually arises from some
powerful cause, such as the loss of what is most dear -- friends,
health, etc. We do not speak of mere sickness or pain as "an
affliction," though one who suffers from either is said to be
afflicted; but deprivations of every kind, such as deafness,
blindness, loss of limbs, etc., are called afflictions, showing that
term applies particularly to prolonged sources of suffering. Sorrow
and grief are much alike in meaning, but grief is the stronger term
of the two, usually denoting poignant mental suffering for some
definite cause, as, grief for the death of a dear friend; sorrow is
more reflective, and is tinged with regret, as, the misconduct of a
child is looked upon with sorrow. Grief is often violent and
demonstrative; sorrow deep and brooding. Distress implies extreme
suffering, either bodily or mental. In its higher stages, it denotes
pain of a restless, agitating kind, and almost always supposes some
struggle of mind or body. Affliction is allayed, grief subsides,
sorrow is soothed, distress is mitigated.

ALKALI SOIL
Alkali soil.

Any one of various soils found in arid and semiarid regions,
containing an unusual amount of soluble mineral salts which
effloresce in the form of a powder or crust in dry
weather following rains or irrigation. The basis of these salts is
mainly soda with a smaller amount of potash, and usually a little
lime and magnesia. Two main classes of alkali are commonly
distinguished: black alkali, which may be any alkaline carbonate, but
which practically consists of sodium carbonate, which is
highly corrosive and destructive to vegetation; and white alkali,
characterized by the presence of sodium sulphate,
which is less injurious to vegetation. Black alkali is so called
because water containing it dissolves humus, forming a dark-colored
solution which, when it collects in puddles and evaporates, produces
characteristic black spots.

ALL
All, a.

1. The whole quantity, extent, duration, amount, quality, or degree
of; the whole; the whole number of; any whatever; every; as, all the
wheat; all the land; all the year; all the strength; all happiness;
all abundance; loss of all power; beyond all doubt; you will see us
all.
Prove all things: hold fast that which is good. 1 Thess. v. 21. 2. Any. "Without all remedy.".

When the definite article "the," or a possessive or a
demonstrative pronoun, is joined to the noun that all qualifies, all
precedes the article or the pronoun; as, all the cattle; all my
labor; all his wealth; all our families; all your citizens; all their
property; all other joys.

This word, not only in popular language, but in the Scriptures,
often signifies, indefinitely, a large portion or number, or a great
part. Thus, all the cattle in Egypt died, all Judea and all the
region round about Jordan, all men held John as a prophet, are not to
be understood in a literal sense, but as including a large part, or
very great numbers.

3. Only; alone; nothing but.

$
ALL
All, adv.

1. Wholly; completely; altogether; entirely; quite; very; as, all
bedewed; my friend is all for amusement. "And cheeks all pale."
Byron.

In the ancient phrases, all too dear, all too much, all so
long, etc., this word retains its appropriate sense or becomes
intensive.

2. Even; just.
All as his straying flock he fed. Spenser.
A damsel lay deploring All on a rock reclined. Gay.
All to, or All-to. In such phrases as "all to rent," "all to break,"
"all-to frozen," etc., which are of frequent occurrence in our old
authors, the all and the to have commonly been regarded as forming a
compound adverb, equivalent in meaning to entirely, completely,
altogether. But the sense of entireness lies wholly in the word all
and the to
properly belongs to the following word, being a kind of intensive
prefix. It is frequently to be met with in old books, used without the
all. Thus Wyclif says, "The vail of the temple was to rent:" and of
Judas, "He was hanged and to-burst the middle:" i. e., burst in two,
or asunder.
-- All along. See under Along.
-- All and some, individually and collectively, one and all.
"Displeased all and some." Fairfax.
-- All but. Scarcely; not even. Almost; nearly.
"The fine arts were all but proscribed.".
-- All hollow, entirely, completely; as, to beat any one all hollow.
-- All one, the same thing in effect; that is, wholly the same
thing.
-- All over, over the whole extent; thoroughly; wholly; as, she is
her mother all over. -- All the better, wholly the better;
that is, better by the whole difference.
-- All the same, nevertheless. "There they
remain rooted all the same, whether we recognize them or not." J. C.
Shairp. "But Rugby is a very nice place all the same." T. Arnold.
-- See also under All, n.

everything or every person; as, our all is at stake.

-- All in all, a phrase which signifies all things to a person, or
everything desired; wholly; altogether.

Trust me not at all, or all in all. Tennyson.
-- All in the wind, a phrase denoting that the sails are
parallel with the course of the wind, so as to e.
-- All told, all counted; in all.
-- And all, and the rest; and everything connected. "Bring our crown
and all.".
-- At all. In every respect; wholly; thoroughly. "She is
a shrew at al.". A phrase much used by way of
enforcement or emphasis, usually in negative or interrogative
sentences, and signifying in any way or respect; in the least degree
or to the least extent; in the least; under any circumstances; as, he
has no ambition at all; has he any property at all "Nothing at all. "
"It thy father at all miss me." 1 Sam. xx. 6. -- Over all, everywhere.

All is much used in composition to enlarge the meaning, or add
force to a word. In some instances, it is completely incorporated
into words, and its final consonant is dropped, as in almighty,
already, always: but, in most instances, it is an adverb prefixed to
adjectives or participles, but usually with a hyphen, as, all-
bountiful, all-glorious, allimportant, all-surrounding, etc. In
others it is an adjective; as, allpower, all-giver. Anciently many
words, as, alabout, alaground, etc., were compounded with all, which
are now written separately.

Syn.
-- Loyalty; fealty.
-- Allegiance, Loyalty. These words agree in expressing the general
idea of fidelity and attachment to the "powers that be." Allegiance
is an obligation to a ruling power. Loyalty is a feeling or sentiment
towards such power. Allegiance may exist under any form of
government, and, in a republic, we generally speak of allegiance to
the government, to the state, etc. In well conducted monarchies,
loyalty is a warm-hearted feeling of fidelity and obedience to the
sovereign. It is personal in its nature; and hence we speak of the
loyalty of a wife to her husband, not of her allegiance. In cases
where we personify, loyalty is more commonly the word used; as,
loyalty to the constitution; loyalty to the cause of virtue; loyalty
to truth and religion, etc.
Hear me, recreant, on thine allegiance hear me!.
So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found,... Unen,

Al"le*go*ry, n.; pl. Allegories.

1. A figurative sentence or discourse, in which the principal subject
is described by another subject resembling it in its properties and
circumstances. The real subject is thus kept out of view, and we are
left to collect the intentions of the writer or speaker by the
resemblance of the secondary to the primary subject.

2. Anything which represents by suggestive resemblance; an emblem.

3. A figure representation which has a meaning beyond notion
directly conveyed by the object painted or sculptured.

Syn.
-- Metaphor; fable.
-- Allegory, Parable. "An allegory differs both from fable and
parable, in that the properties of persons are fictitiously
represented as attached to things, to which they are as it were
transferred.... A figure of Peace and Victory crowning some
historical personage is an allegory. "I am the Vine, ye are the
branches" is a spoken allegory. In the parable there
is no transference of properties. The parable of the sower represents all things as according to their proper
nature. In the allegory quoted above the properties of the vine and
the relation of the branches are transferred to the person of Christ
and His apostles and disciples." C. J. Smith.

An allegory is a prolonged metaphor. Bunyan's "Pilgrim's
Progress" and Spenser's "Faerie Queene" are celebrated examples of
the allegory.

As we know that the several unit characters are of such a nature that
any one of them is capable of independently displacing or being
displaced by one or more alternative characters taken singly, we may
recognize this fact by naming such characters allelomorphs.
Bateson.

manner in which it was managed. Prideoux.

-- Amicable numbers, two numbers, each of which is equal to
the sum of all the aliquot parts of the other.

Syn.
-- Friendly; peaceable; kind; harmonious.
-- Amicable, Friendly. Neither of these words denotes any great
warmth of affection, since friendly has by no means the same strength
as its noun friendship. It does, however, imply something of real
cordiality; while amicable supposes very little more than that the
parties referred to are not disposed to quarrel. Hence, we speak of
amicable relations between two countries, an amicable adjustment of
difficulties. "Those who entertain friendly feelings toward each
other can live amicably together."

Syn.
-- Amidst, Among. These words differ to some extent from each other,
as will be seen from their etymology. Amidst denotes in the midst or
middle of, and hence surrounded by; as, this work was written amidst
many interruptions. Among denotes a mingling or intermixing with
distinct or separable objects; as, "He fell among thieves." "Blessed
art thou among women." Hence, we say, among the moderns, among the
ancients, among the thickest of trees, among these considerations,
among the reasons I have to offer. Amid and amidst are commonly used
when the idea of separate or distinguishable objects is not
prominent. Hence, we say, they kept on amidst the storm, amidst the
gloom, he was sinking amidst the waves, he persevered amidst many
difficulties; in none of which cases could among be used. In like
manner, speaks of Abdiel, --
The seraph Abdiel, faithful found; Among the faithless faithful only
he, because he was then considered as one of the angels. But when the
poet adds, --
From amidst them forth he passed, we have rather the idea of the
angels as a collective body.

Syn.
-- Old; primitive; pristine; antique; antiquated; old-fashioned;
obsolete.
-- Ancient, Antiquated, Obsolete, Antique, Antic, Old.
-- Ancient is opposed to modern, and has antiquity; as, an ancient
family, ancient landmarks, ancient institutions, systems of thought,
etc. Antiquated describes that which has gone out of use or fashion;
as, antiquated furniture, antiquated laws, rules, etc. Obsolete is
commonly used, instead of antiquated, in reference to language,
customs, etc.; as, an obsolete word or phrase, an obsolete
expression. Antique is applied, in present usage, either to that
which has come down from the ancients; as, an antique cameo, bust,
etc.; or to that which is made to imitate some ancient work of art;
as, an antique temple. In the days of espeare, antique was often
used for ancient; as, "an antique song," "an antique Roman;" and
hence, from singularity often attached to what is ancient, it was
used in the sense of grotesque; as, "an oak whose antique root peeps
out; " and hence came our present word antic, denoting grotesque or
ridiculous. We usually apply both ancient and old to things subject
to gradual decay. We say, an old man, an ancient record; but never,
the old stars, an old river or mountain. In general, however, ancient
is opposed to modern, and old to new, fresh, or recent. When we speak
of a thing that existed formerly, which has ceased to exist, we
commonly use ancient; as, ancient republics, ancient heroes; and not
old republics, old heroes. But when the thing which began or existed
in former times is still in existence, we use either ancient or old;
as, ancient statues or paintings, or old statues or paintings;
ancient authors, or old authors, meaning books.

limited by strict rules of probability. Æsop's fables are good
examples of apologues.

Syn.
-- Excuse. An apology, in the original sense of the word, was a
pleading off from some charge or imputation, by explaining and
defending one's principles or conduct. It therefore amounted to a
vindication. One who offers an apology, admits himself to have been,
at least apparently, in the wrong, but brings forward some palliating
circumstance, or tenders a frank acknowledgment, by way of
reparation. We make an apology for some breach of propriety or
decorum, or some
deficiency in what might be reasonably expected. We offer an excuse
when we have been guilty of some breach or neglect of duty; and we do
it by way of extenuating our fault, and with a view to be forgiven.
When an excuse has been accepted, an apology may still, in some
cases, be necessary or appropriate. "An excuse is not grounded on the
claim of innocence, but is rather an appeal for favor resting on some
collateral circumstance. An apology mostly respects the conduct of
individuals toward each other as equals; it is a voluntary act
produced by feelings of decorum, or a desire for the good opinion of
others." Crabb.

Syn.
-- To Appreciate, Estimate, Esteem. Estimate is an act of judgment;
esteem is an act of valuing or prizing, and when applied to
individuals, denotes a sentiment of moral approbation. See Estimate.
Appreciate lies between the two. As compared with estimate, it
supposes a union of sensibility with judgment, producing a nice and
delicate perception. As compared with esteem, it denotes a valuation
of things according to their appropriate and distinctive excellence,
and not simply their moral worth. Thus, with reference to the former
of these, an able writer says. "Women have a
truer appreciation of character than men;" and another remarks, "It
is difficult to appreciate the true force and distinctive sense of
terms which we are every day using." So, also, we speak of the
difference between two things, as sometimes hardly appreciable. With
reference to the latter of these, we say, "It requires a peculiar cast of character
to appreciate the poetry of Wordsworth;" "He who has no delicacy
himself, can not appreciate it in others;" "The thought of death is
salutary, because it leads us to appreciate worldly things aright."
Appreciate is much used in cases where something is in danger of
being overlooked or undervalued; as when we speak of appreciating the
difficulties of a subject, or the risk of an undertaking. So Lord
Plunket, referring to an "ominous silence" which prevailed among the
Irish peasantry, says, "If you knew now to appreciate that silence,
it is more formidable than the most clamorous opposition." In like
manner, a person who asks some favor of another is apt to say, "I
trust you will appreciate my motives in this request." Here we have
the key to a very frequent use of the word. It is hardly necessary to
say that appreciate looks on the favorable side of things. we never
speak of appreciating a man's faults, but his merits. This idea of
regarding things favorably appears more fully in the word
appreciative; as when we speak of an appreciative audience, or an
appreciative review, meaning one that manifests a quick perception
and a ready valuation of excellence.

thing mentally, so as to understand it clearly, at least in part.
Comprehend denotes the embracing or understanding it in all its
compass and extent. We may apprehended many truths which we do not
comprehend. The very idea of God supposes that he may be apprehended,

of espeare's aim and intention in the character of Hamlet or King
Lear; but few will claim that they have comprehended all that is

not governed by personal feelings or choice, but by a deliberate,
judgment as to the common good. We also use assent in cases where a

lady may assent to a gentleman's opening the window; but if he offers
himself in marriage, he must wait for her consent.

4. A seizure or taking into custody by virtue of a legal process.
The writ or percept commanding such seizure or taking.

The term is applied to a seizure or taking either of persons or

generally applied to the taking of property, whether at common law,
as a species of distress, to compel defendant's appearance, or under
local statutes, to satisfy the judgment the plaintiff may recover in
the action. The terms attachment and arrest are both applied to the
taking or apprehension of a defendant to compel an appearance in a
civil action. Attachments are issued at common law and in chancery,
against persons for contempt of court. In England, attachment is
employed in some cases where capias is with us, as against a witness
who fails to appear on summons. In some of the New England States a
writ of attachment is a species of mesne process upon which the
property of a defendant may be seized at the commencement of a suit
and before summons to him, and may be held to satisfy the judgment
the plaintiff may recover. In other States this writ can issue only
against absconding debtors and those who conceal themselves. See
Foreign, Garnishment, Trustee process. Burrill. Blackstone.

Syn.
-- Attachment, Affection. The leading idea of affection is that of
warmth and tenderness; the leading idea of attachment is that of
being bound to some object by strong and lasting ties. There is more
of sentiment in affection, and more of
principle in preserving attachment. We speak of the ardor of the one,
and the fidelity of the other. There is another distinction in the
use and application of these words. The term attachment is applied to
a wider range of objects than affection. A man may have a strong
attachment to his country, to his profession, to his principles, and
even to favorite places; in respect to none of these could we use the
word affection.

ATTACK
At*tack", v. t.


1. To fall upon with force; to assail, as with force and arms; to
assault. "Attack their lines." Dryden.

2. To assail with unfriendly speech or writing; to begin a
controversy with; to attempt to overthrow or bring into disrepute, by

4. To begin to affect; to begin to act upon, injuriously or

Hydrofluoric acid... attacks the glass. B. Stewart.

Syn.
-- To Attack, Assail, Assault, Invade. These words all denote a
violent onset; attack being the generic term, and the others specific
forms of attack. To attack is to commence the onset; to assail is to
make a sudden and violent attack, or to make repeated attacks; to
assault is to attack physically by a had-
to-hand approach or by unlawful and insulting violence; to invade is
to enter by force on what belongs to another. Thus, a person may
attack by offering violence of any kind; he may assail by means of
missile weapons; he may assault by direct personal violence; a king
may invade by marching an army into a country. Figuratively, we may
say, men attack with argument or satire; they assail with abuse or
reproaches; they may be assaulted by severe temptations; the rights
of the people may be invaded by the encroachments of the crown.

the forfeiture of all the real and personal property of the condemned
person, and such "corruption of blood" that he could neither receive
nor transmit by inheritance, nor could he sue or testify in any
court, or claim any legal protection or rights. In England attainders
are now abolished, and in the United States the Constitution provides
that no bill of attainder shall be passed; and no attainder of
treason shall work corruption
of blood or forfeiture, except during the life of the person
attainted.

Syn.
-- Attitude, Posture. Both of these words describe the visible
disposition of the limbs. Posture relates to their position merely;
attitude refers to their fitness for some specific object. The object
of an attitude is to set forth exhibit some internal feeling; as,
attitude of wonder, of admiration, of grief, etc. It is, therefore,
essentially and designedly expressive. Its object is the same with
that of gesture; viz., to hold forth and represent. Posture has no
such design. If we speak of posture in prayer, or the posture of
devotion, it is only the natural disposition of the limbs, without
any intention to show forth or exhibit.
'T is business of a painter in his choice of attitudes to
foresee the effect and harmony of the lights and shadows. Dryden.

At*tor"ney, n.; pl. Attorneys.

2. One who is legally appointed by another to transact any business
for him; an attorney in fact.
A legal agent qualified to act for suitors and defendants in
legal proceedings; an attorney at law.

An attorney is either public or private. A private attorney, or
an attorney in fact, is a person appointed by another, by a letter or
power of attorney, to transact any business for him out of court; but
in a more extended sense, this class includes any agent employed in
any business, or to do any act in pais, for another. A public
attorney, or attorney at law, is a practitioner in a court of law,
legally qualified to prosecute and defend actions in such court, on
the retainer of clients.
-- The attorney at law answers to the procurator of the civilians,
to the solicitor in chancery, and to the proctor in the
ecclesiastical and admiralty courts, and all of these are
comprehended under the more general term lawyer. In Great Britain and
in some states of the United States, attorneys are distinguished from
counselors in that the business of the former is to carry on the
practical and formal parts of the suit. In many states of the United
States however, no such distinction exists. In England, since 1873,
attorneys at law are by statute called solicitors. A power, letter,
or warrant, of attorney, a written authority from one person
empowering another to transact business for him.

1. An invisible power in a body by which it draws anything to
itself; the power in nature acting mutually between bodies or
ultimate particles, tending to draw them together, or to produce

Attraction is exerted at both sensible and insensible
distances, and is variously denominated according to its qualities or
phenomena. Under attraction at sensible distances, there are, --
Attraction of gravitation, which acts at all distances throughout the
universe, with a force proportional directly to the product of the
masses of the bodies and inversely to the square of their distances
apart. Magnetic, diamagnetic, and electrical attraction, each of
which is limited in its sensible range and is polar in its action, a
property dependent on the quality or condition of matter, and not on
its quantity. Under attraction at insensible distances, there are, --
Adhesive attraction, attraction between surfaces of sensible
extent, or by the medium of an intervening substance. Cohesive
attraction, attraction between ultimate particles, whether like or
unlike, and causing simply an aggregation or a union of those
particles, as in the absorption of gases by charcoal, or of oxygen by
spongy platinum, or the process of solidification or crystallization.
The power in adhesive attraction is strictly the same as that of
cohesion. Capillary attraction, attraction causing a liquid to
rise, in capillary tubes or interstices, above its level outside, as
in very small glass tubes, or a sponge, or any porous substance, when
one end is inserted in the liquid. It is a special case of cohesive
attraction. Chemical attraction, or affinity, that peculiar
force which causes elementary atoms, or groups of atoms, to unite to
form molecules.

Syn.
-- Authentic, Genuine. These words, as here compared, have reference
to historical documents. We call a document genuine when it can be
traced back ultimately to the author or authors from whom it
professes to emanate. Hence, the word has the meaning, "not changed
from the original, uncorrupted, unadulterated:" as, a genuine text.
We call a document authentic when, on the ground of its being thus
traced back, it may be relied on as true and authoritative; hence its extended
signification, in general literature, of trustworthy, as resting on
unquestionable authority or evidence; as, an authentic history; an
authentic report of facts.
A genuine book is that which was written by the person whose name it
bears, as the author of it. An authentic book is that which relates
matters of fact as they really happened. A book may be genuine
without being, authentic, and a book may be authentic without being
genuine. Bp. Watson.

It may be said, however, that some writers use authentic in the sense of "produced by its professed
author, not counterfeit."
